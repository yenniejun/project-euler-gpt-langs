# GPT-4 can solve math problems â€” but not in all languages
*A few experiments making GPT-4 solve math problems in 16 different languages*

This repository includes the code used in the related article. In the article, I prompt GPT-4 in 16 different languages to solve a subset of Project Euler problems. I find that GPT-4 is much better at solving problems in certain languages (e.g. English, German, Spanish) than others (e.g. Amharic, Burmese, Farsi).
