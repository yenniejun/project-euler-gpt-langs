A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.
A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.
As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.

54,Poker hands,Problem 54,"
In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from lowest to highest, in the following way:
High Card: Highest value card.
One Pair: Two cards of the same value.
Two Pairs: Two different pairs.
Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same value.
Straight: All cards are consecutive values.
Flush: All cards of the same suit.
Full House: Three of a kind and a pair.
Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same value.
Straight Flush: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
Royal Flush: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.
The cards are valued in the order:2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4 below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared, and so on.
Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:

55,Lychrel numbers,Problem 55,"
If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.
Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,
349 + 943 = 1292,
1292 + 2921 = 4213
4213 + 3124 = 7337
That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196, never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem, we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i) become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require over fifty iterations before producing a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).
Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel numbers; the first example is 4994.

Each character on a computer is assigned a unique code and the preferred standard is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.
A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key. The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.
For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both ""halves"", it is impossible to decrypt the message.
Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.
Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters. Using p059_cipher.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.

All square roots are periodic when written as continued fractions and can be written in the form:
N=a0+1a1+1a2+1a3+…
For example, let us consider 23:
23=4+23−4=4+1123−4=4+11+23−37
If we continue we would get the following expansion:

A player starts on the GO square and adds the scores on two 6-sided dice to determine the number of squares they advance in a clockwise direction. Without any further rules we would expect to visit each square with equal probability: 2.5%. However, landing on G2J (Go To Jail), CC (community chest), and CH (chance) changes this distribution.
In addition to G2J, and one card from each of CC and CH, that orders the player to go directly to jail, if a player rolls three consecutive doubles, they do not advance the result of their 3rd roll. Instead they proceed directly to jail.
At the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile. There are sixteen cards in each pile, but for the purpose of this problem we are only concerned with cards that order a movement; any instruction not concerned with movement will be ignored and the player will remain on the CC/CH square.
Community Chest (2/16 cards):
Advance to GO
Go to JAIL

Chance (10/16 cards):
Advance to GO
Go to JAIL
Go to C1
Go to E3
Go to H2
Go to R1
Go to next R (railway company)
Go to next R
Go to next U (utility company)
Go back 3 squares.

The heart of this problem concerns the likelihood of visiting a particular square. That is, the probability of finishing at that square after a roll. For this reason it should be clear that, with the exception of G2J for which the probability of finishing on it is zero, the CH squares will have the lowest probabilities, as 5/8 request a movement to another square, and it is the final square that the player finishes at on each roll that we are interested in. We shall make no distinction between ""Just Visiting"" and being sent to JAIL, and we shall also ignore the rule about requiring a double to ""get out of jail"", assuming that they pay to get out on their next turn.
By starting at GO and numbering the squares sequentially from 00 to 39 we can concatenate these two-digit numbers to produce strings that correspond with sets of squares.
Statistically it can be shown that the three most popular squares, in order, are JAIL (6.24%) = Square 10, E3 (3.18%) = Square 24, and GO (3.09%) = Square 00. So these three most popular squares can be listed with the six-digit modal string: 102400.
If, instead of using two 6-sided dice, two 4-sided dice are used, find the six-digit modal string.

88,Product-sum numbers,Problem 88,"
A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, {a1, a2, ... , ak} is called a product-sum number: N = a1 + a2 + ... + ak = a1 × a2 × ... × ak.
For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3.
For a given set of size, k, we shall call the smallest N with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, k = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.
k=2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2k=3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3k=4: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4k=5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2  = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2k=6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6
Hence for 2≤k≤6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is 4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.
In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for 2≤k≤12 is {4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16}, the sum is 61.

90,Cube digit pairs,Problem 90,"
Each of the six faces on a cube has a different digit (0 to 9) written on it; the same is done to a second cube. By placing the two cubes side-by-side in different positions we can form a variety of 2-digit numbers.
For example, the square number 64 could be formed:


In fact, by carefully choosing the digits on both cubes it is possible to display all of the square numbers below one-hundred: 01, 04, 09, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, and 81.
For example, one way this can be achieved is by placing {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} on one cube and {1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9} on the other cube.
However, for this problem we shall allow the 6 or 9 to be turned upside-down so that an arrangement like {0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} and {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7} allows for all nine square numbers to be displayed; otherwise it would be impossible to obtain 09.
In determining a distinct arrangement we are interested in the digits on each cube, not the order.
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is equivalent to {3, 6, 4, 1, 2, 5}
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is distinct from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9}
But because we are allowing 6 and 9 to be reversed, the two distinct sets in the last example both represent the extended set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9} for the purpose of forming 2-digit numbers.

The proper divisors of a number are all the divisors excluding the number itself. For example, the proper divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. As the sum of these divisors is equal to 28, we call it a perfect number.
Interestingly the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284 and the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220, forming a chain of two numbers. For this reason, 220 and 284 are called an amicable pair.

Su Doku (Japanese meaning number place) is the name given to a popular puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to Leonhard Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle idea called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid.

     
A well constructed Su Doku puzzle has a unique solution and can be solved by logic, although it may be necessary to employ ""guess and test"" methods in order to eliminate options (there is much contested opinion over this).

","<p>Su Doku (Japanese meaning <i>number place</i>) is the name given to a popular puzzle concept. Its origin is unclear, but credit must be attributed to Leonhard Euler who invented a similar, and much more difficult, puzzle idea called Latin Squares. The objective of Su Doku puzzles, however, is to replace the blanks (or zeros) in a 9 by 9 grid in such that each row, column, and 3 by 3 box contains each of the digits 1 to 9. Below is an example of a typical starting puzzle grid and its solution grid.</p>

101,Optimum polynomial,Problem 101,"
If we are presented with the first k terms of a sequence it is impossible to say with certainty the value of the next term, as there are infinitely many polynomial functions that can model the sequence.
As an example, let us consider the sequence of cube numbers. This is defined by the generating function, un = n3: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, ...
Suppose we were only given the first two terms of this sequence. Working on the principle that ""simple is best"" we should assume a linear relationship and predict the next term to be 15 (common difference 7). Even if we were presented with the first three terms, by the same principle of simplicity, a quadratic relationship should be assumed.
We shall define OP(k, n) to be the nth term of the optimum polynomial generating function for the first k terms of a sequence. It should be clear that OP(k, n) will accurately generate the terms of the sequence for n ≤ k, and potentially the first incorrect term (FIT) will be OP(k, k+1); in which case we shall call it a bad OP (BOP).
As a basis, if we were only given the first term of sequence, it would be most sensible to assume constancy; that is, for n ≥ 2, OP(1, n) = u1.
Hence we obtain the following OPs for the cubic sequence:

OP(1, n) = 1
1, 1, 1, 1, ...
OP(2, n) = 7n−6
1, 8, 15, ...
OP(3, n) = 6n2−11n+6     
1, 8, 27, 58, ...
OP(4, n) = n3
1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ...

Clearly no BOPs exist for k ≥ 4.
By considering the sum of FITs generated by the BOPs (indicated in red above), we obtain 1 + 15 + 58 = 74.
Consider the following tenth degree polynomial generating function:
un = 1 − n + n2 − n3 + n4 − n5 + n6 − n7 + n8 − n9 + n10
Find the sum of FITs for the BOPs.

S(B) ≠ S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
If S(A) is minimised for a given n, we shall call it an optimum special sum set. The first five optimum special sum sets are given below.

109,Darts,Problem 109,"
In the game of darts a player throws three darts at a target board which is split into twenty equal sized sections numbered one to twenty.


The score of a dart is determined by the number of the region that the dart lands in. A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and treble scores respectively.
At the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull is a double, worth 50 points.
There are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a ""doubles out"" system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is ""bust"".
When a player is able to finish  on their current score it is called a ""checkout"" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and double bull).
There are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:

     
     
     
D3D1D2S2D2D2D1S4D1S1S1D2S1T1D1S1S3D1D1D1D1D1S2D1S2S2D1
Note that D1 D2 is considered different to D2 D1 as they finish on different doubles. However, the combination S1 T1 D1 is considered the same as T1 S1 D1.
In addition we shall not include misses in considering combinations; for example, D3 is the same as 0 D3 and 0 0 D3.
Incredibly there are 42336 distinct ways of checking out in total.
How many distinct ways can a player checkout with a score less than 100?

111,Primes with runs,Problem 111,"
Considering 4-digit primes containing repeated digits it is clear that they cannot all be the same: 1111 is divisible by 11, 2222 is divisible by 22, and so on. But there are nine 4-digit primes containing three ones:
1117, 1151, 1171, 1181, 1511, 1811, 2111, 4111, 8111
We shall say that M(n, d) represents the maximum number of repeated digits for an n-digit prime where d is the repeated digit, N(n, d) represents the number of such primes, and S(n, d) represents the sum of these primes.
So M(4, 1) = 3 is the maximum number of repeated digits for a 4-digit prime where one is the repeated digit, there are N(4, 1) = 9 such primes, and the sum of these primes is S(4, 1) = 22275. It turns out that for d = 0, it is only possible to have M(4, 0) = 2 repeated digits, but there are N(4, 0) = 13 such cases.
In the same way we obtain the following results for 4-digit primes.

Torricelli was able to prove that if equilateral triangles AOB, BNC and AMC are constructed on each side of triangle ABC, the circumscribed circles of AOB, BNC, and AMC will intersect at a single point, T, inside the triangle. Moreover he proved that T, called the Torricelli/Fermat point, minimises p + q + r.

In laser physics, a ""white cell"" is a mirror system that acts as a delay line for the laser beam. The beam enters the cell, bounces around on the mirrors, and eventually works its way back out.
The specific white cell we will be considering is an ellipse with the equation 4x2 + y2 = 100
The section corresponding to −0.01 ≤ x ≤ +0.01 at the top is missing, allowing the light to enter and exit through the hole.

The light beam in this problem starts at the point (0.0,10.1) just outside the white cell, and the beam first impacts the mirror at (1.4,-9.6).
Each time the laser beam hits the surface of the ellipse, it follows the usual law of reflection ""angle of incidence equals angle of reflection."" That is, both the incident and reflected beams make the same angle with the normal line at the point of incidence.
In the figure on the left, the red line shows the first two points of contact between the laser beam and the wall of the white cell; the blue line shows the line tangent to the ellipse at the point of incidence of the first bounce.The slope m of the tangent line at any point (x,y) of the given ellipse is: m = −4x/yThe normal line is perpendicular to this tangent line at the point of incidence.
The animation on the right shows the first 10 reflections of the beam.

For 1 ≤ k ≤ 55, sk = [100003 − 200003k + 300007k3] (modulo 1000000) − 500000.
For 56 ≤ k ≤ 4000000, sk = [sk−24 + sk−55 + 1000000] (modulo 1000000) − 500000.
Thus, s10 = −393027 and s100 = 86613.

150,Searching a triangular array for a sub-triangle having minimum-sum,Problem 150,"
In a triangular array of positive and negative integers, we wish to find a sub-triangle such that the sum of the numbers it contains is the smallest possible.
In the example below, it can be easily verified that the marked triangle satisfies this condition having a sum of −42.


We wish to make such a triangular array with one thousand rows, so we generate 500500 pseudo-random numbers sk in the range ±219, using a type of random number generator (known as a Linear Congruential Generator) as follows:
t := 0

for k = 1 up to k = 500500:

    t := (615949*t + 797807) modulo 220
    sk := t−219
Thus: s1 = 273519, s2 = −153582, s3 = 450905 etc
Our triangular array is then formed using the pseudo-random numbers thus:

s1
s2  s3
s4  s5  s6  

s7  s8  s9  s10
...

Sub-triangles can start at any element of the array and extend down as far as we like (taking-in the two elements directly below it from the next row, the three elements directly below from the row after that, and so on).

The ""sum of a sub-triangle"" is defined as the sum of all the elements it contains.

Find the smallest possible sub-triangle sum.

151,Paper sheets of standard sizes: an expected-value problem,Problem 151,"
A printing shop runs 16 batches (jobs) every week and each batch requires a sheet of special colour-proofing paper of size A5.
Every Monday morning, the supervisor opens a new envelope, containing a large sheet of the special paper with size A1.
The supervisor proceeds to cut it in half, thus getting two sheets of size A2. Then one of the sheets is cut in half to get two sheets of size A3 and so on until an A5-size sheet is obtained, which is needed for the first batch of the week.
All the unused sheets are placed back in the envelope.

At the beginning of each subsequent batch, the supervisor takes from the envelope one sheet of paper at random. If it is of size A5, then it is used. If it is larger, then the 'cut-in-half' procedure is repeated until an A5-size sheet is obtained, and any remaining sheets are always placed back in the envelope.
Excluding the first and last batch of the week, find the expected number of times (during each week) that the supervisor finds a single sheet of paper in the envelope.

153,Investigating Gaussian Integers,Problem 153,"
As we all know the equation x2=-1 has no solutions for real x.

If we however introduce the imaginary number i this equation has two solutions: x=i and x=-i.

If we go a step further the equation (x-3)2=-4 has two complex solutions: x=3+2i and x=3-2i.
x=3+2i and x=3-2i are called each others' complex conjugate.

Numbers of the form a+bi are called complex numbers.

In general a+bi and a−bi are each other's complex conjugate.
A Gaussian Integer is a complex number a+bi such that both a and b are integers.

The regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with b=0).

To distinguish them from Gaussian integers with b ≠ 0 we call such integers ""rational integers.""

A Gaussian integer is called a divisor of a rational integer n if the result is also a Gaussian integer.

If for example we divide 5 by 1+2i we can simplify 51+2i in the following manner:

Multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 1+2i: 1−2i.

The result is 51+2i=51+2i1−2i1−2i=5(1−2i)1−(2i)2=5(1−2i)1−(−4)=5(1−2i)5=1−2i.

So 1+2i is a divisor of 5.

Note that 1+i is not a divisor of 5 because 51+i=52−52i.

Note also that if the Gaussian Integer (a+bi) is a divisor of a rational integer n, then its complex conjugate (a−bi) is also a divisor of n.
In fact, 5 has six divisors such that the real part is positive: {1, 1 + 2i, 1 − 2i, 2 + i, 2 − i, 5}.

The following is a table of all of the divisors for the first five positive rational integers:

The result is $\dfrac{5}{1 + 2i} = \dfrac{5}{1 + 2i}\dfrac{1 - 2i}{1 - 2i} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (2i)^2} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{1 - (-4)} = \dfrac{5(1 - 2i)}{5} = 1 - 2i$.
<br />
So 1+2<var>i</var> is a divisor of 5.

Note that 1+<var>i</var> is not a divisor of 5 because $\dfrac{5}{1 + i} = \dfrac{5}{2} - \dfrac{5}{2}i$.

158,Exploring strings for which only one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left,Problem 158,"
Taking three different letters from the 26 letters of the alphabet, character strings of length three can be formed.
Examples are 'abc', 'hat' and 'zyx'.
When we study these three examples we see that for 'abc' two characters come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left. 
For 'hat' there is exactly one character that comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left. For 'zyx' there are zero characters that come lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
In all there are 10400 strings of length 3 for which exactly one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
We now consider strings of n ≤ 26 different characters from the alphabet. 
For every n, p(n) is the number of strings of length n for which exactly one character comes lexicographically after its neighbour to the left.
What is the maximum value of p(n)?

165,Intersections,Problem 165,"
A segment is uniquely defined by its two endpoints. By considering two line segments in plane geometry there are three possibilities: 
the segments have zero points, one point, or infinitely many points in common.
Moreover when two segments have exactly one point in common it might be the case that that common point is an endpoint of either one of the segments or of both. If a common point of two segments is not an endpoint of either of the segments it is an interior point of both segments.
We will call a common point T of two segments L1 and L2 a true intersection point of L1 and L2  if T is the only common point of L1 and L2  and T is an interior point of both segments.

Consider the three segments L1, L2, and L3:
L1: (27, 44) to (12, 32)
L2: (46, 53) to (17, 62)
L3: (46, 70) to (22, 40)
It can be verified that line segments L2 and L3 have a true intersection point. We note that as the one of the end points of L3: (22,40) lies on L1 this is not considered to be a true point of intersection. L1 and L2 have no common point. So among the three line segments, we find one true intersection point.
Now let us do the same for 5000 line segments. To this end, we generate 20000 numbers using the so-called ""Blum Blum Shub"" pseudo-random number generator.
s0 = 290797
sn+1 = sn×sn (modulo 50515093)
tn = sn (modulo 500)
To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers tn. That is, the first line segment is given by:
(t1, t2) to (t3, t4)
The first four numbers computed according to the above generator should be: 27, 144, 12 and 232. The first segment would thus be (27,144) to (12,232).

The RSA encryption is based on the following procedure:
Generate two distinct primes p and q.Compute n=pq and φ=(p-1)(q-1).
Find an integer e, 1<e<φ, such that gcd(e,φ)=1.
A message in this system is a number in the interval [0,n-1].
A text to be encrypted is then somehow converted to messages (numbers in the interval [0,n-1]).
To encrypt the text,  for each message, m, c=me mod n is calculated.
To decrypt the text, the following procedure is needed: calculate d such that ed=1 mod φ, then for each encrypted message, c, calculate m=cd mod n.
There exist values of e and m  such that me mod n=m.We call messages m for which me mod n=m unconcealed messages.
An issue when choosing e is that there should not be too many unconcealed messages.  For instance, let p=19 and q=37.
Then n=19*37=703 and φ=18*36=648.
If we choose e=181, then, although gcd(181,648)=1 it turns out that all possible messagesm (0≤m≤n-1) are unconcealed when calculating me mod n.
For any valid choice of e there exist some unconcealed messages.
It's important that the number of unconcealed messages is at a minimum.

199,Iterative Circle Packing,Problem 199,"
Three circles of equal radius are placed inside a larger circle such that each pair of circles is tangent to one another and the inner circles do not overlap. There are four uncovered ""gaps"" which are to be filled iteratively with more tangent circles.



At each iteration, a maximally sized circle is placed in each gap, which creates more gaps for the next iteration. After 3 iterations (pictured), there are 108 gaps and the fraction of the area which is not covered by circles is 0.06790342, rounded to eight decimal places.


What fraction of the area is not covered by circles after 10 iterations?

Consider the number 3600. It is very special, because

3600 = 482 +     362
3600 = 202 + 2×402
3600 = 302 + 3×302
3600 = 452 + 7×152
Similarly, we find that 88201 = 992 + 2802 = 2872 + 2×542 = 2832 + 3×522 = 1972 + 7×842.
In 1747, Euler proved which numbers are representable as a sum of two squares.
We are interested in the numbers n which admit representations of all of the following four types:

n = a12 +   b12n = a22 + 2 b22n = a32 + 3 b32n = a72 + 7 b72,

where the ak and bk are positive integers.
There are 75373 such numbers that do not exceed 107.

How many such numbers are there that do not exceed 2×109?

For an integer n ≥ 4, we define the lower prime square root of n, denoted by lps(n), as the largest prime ≤ √n and the upper prime square root of n, ups(n), as the smallest prime ≥ √n.
So, for example, lps(4) = 2 = ups(4), lps(1000) = 31, ups(1000) = 37.
Let us call an integer n ≥ 4 semidivisible, if one of lps(n) and ups(n) divides n, but not both.
The sum of the semidivisible numbers not exceeding 15 is 30, the numbers are 8, 10 and 12. 15 is not semidivisible because it is a multiple of both lps(15) = 3 and ups(15) = 5.

Concatenate these numbers  s0s1s2… to create a string w of infinite length.
Then, w = 14025256741014958470038053646…
For a positive integer k, if no substring of w exists with a sum of digits equal to k, p(k) is defined to be zero. If at least one substring of w exists with a sum of digits equal to k, we define p(k) = z, where z is the starting position of the earliest such substring.
For instance:
The substrings 1, 14, 1402, …

A small child has a “number caterpillar” consisting of forty jigsaw pieces, each with one number on it, which, when connected together in a line, reveal the numbers 1 to 40 in order.
Every night, the child's father has to pick up the pieces of the caterpillar that have been scattered across the play room. He picks up the pieces at random and places them in the correct order. As the caterpillar is built up in this way, it forms distinct segments that gradually merge together. The number of segments starts at zero (no pieces placed), generally increases up to about eleven or twelve, then tends to drop again before finishing at a single segment (all pieces placed).
For example:

Piece Placed

Let M be the maximum number of segments encountered during a random tidy-up of the caterpillar.
For a caterpillar of ten pieces, the number of possibilities for each M is

255,Rounded Square Roots,Problem 255,"
We define the rounded-square-root of a positive integer n as the square root of n rounded to the nearest integer.
The following procedure (essentially Heron's method adapted to integer arithmetic) finds the rounded-square-root of n:
Let d be the number of digits of the number n.
If d is odd, set x0=2×10(d−1)/2.
If d is even, set x0=7×10(d−2)/2.
Repeat:
xk+1=⌊xk+⌈n/xk⌉2⌋
until xk+1=xk.
As an example, let us find the rounded-square-root of n = 4321.n has 4 digits, so x0=7×10(4−2)/2=70.
x1=⌊70+⌈4321/70⌉2⌋=66
x2=⌊66+⌈4321/66⌉2⌋=66

Since x2=x1, we stop here.
So, after just two iterations, we have found that the rounded-square-root of 4321 is 66 (the actual square root is 65.7343137…).

The number of iterations required when using this method is surprisingly low.
For example, we can find the rounded-square-root of a 5-digit integer (10,000 ≤ n ≤ 99,999) with an average of 3.2102888889 iterations (the average value was rounded to 10 decimal places).

Using the procedure described above, what is the average number of iterations required to find the rounded-square-root of a 14-digit number (1013 ≤ n < 1014)?
Give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.

Note: The symbols ⌊x⌋ and ⌈x⌉ represent the floor function and ceiling function respectively.

256,Tatami-Free Rooms,Problem 256,"

Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room, without overlap.
Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1×2, there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that can be covered.
For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer dimensions a, b and even size s = a·b.
We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and — without loss of generality — we add the condition a ≤ b.
There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points where corners of four different mats meet.
For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4×4 room:


The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is not: a red ""X"" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.
Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms.
Further, we define T(s) as the number of tatami-free rooms of size s.
The smallest tatami-free room has size s = 70 and dimensions 7×10.
All the other rooms of size s = 70 can be covered with tatami; they are: 1×70, 2×35 and 5×14.
Hence, T(70) = 1.
Similarly, we can verify that T(1320) = 5 because there are exactly 5 tatami-free rooms of size s = 1320:
20×66, 22×60, 24×55, 30×44 and 33×40.
In fact, s = 1320 is the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 5.
Find the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 200.

A game is played with three piles of stones and two players.
On each player's turn, the player may remove one or more stones from the piles. However, if the player takes stones from more than one pile, then the same number of stones must be removed from each of the selected piles.
In other words, the player chooses some N>0 and removes:
N stones from any single pile; or
N stones from each of any two piles (2N total); or
N stones from each of the three piles (3N total).
The player taking the last stone(s) wins the game.
A winning configuration is one where the first player can force a win.
For example, (0,0,13), (0,11,11), and (5,5,5) are winning configurations because the first player can immediately remove all stones.
A losing configuration is one where the second player can force a win, no matter what the first player does.
For example, (0,1,2) and (1,3,3) are losing configurations: any legal move leaves a winning configuration for the second player.
Consider all losing configurations (xi,yi,zi) where xi≤yi≤zi≤100.

265,Binary Circles,Problem 265,"
2N binary digits can be placed in a circle so that all the N-digit clockwise subsequences are distinct.
For N=3, two such circular arrangements are possible, ignoring rotations:

For the first arrangement, the 3-digit subsequences, in clockwise order, are: 000, 001, 010, 101, 011, 111, 110 and 100.
Each circular arrangement can be encoded as a number by concatenating the binary digits starting with the subsequence of all zeros as the most significant bits and proceeding clockwise. The two arrangements for N=3 are thus represented as 23 and 29:
00010111 2 = 23
00011101 2 = 29
Calling S(N) the sum of the unique numeric representations, we can see that S(3) = 23 + 29 = 52.

A laborious ant walks randomly on a 5x5 grid. The walk starts from the central square. At each step, the ant moves to an adjacent square at random, without leaving the grid; thus there are 2, 3 or 4 possible moves at each step depending on the ant's position.
At the start of the walk, a seed is placed on each square of the lower row. When the ant isn't carrying a seed and reaches a square of the lower row containing a seed, it will start to carry the seed. The ant will drop the seed on the first empty square of the upper row it eventually reaches.
What's the expected number of steps until all seeds have been dropped in the top row? 
Give your answer rounded to 6 decimal places.

Four points with integer coordinates are selected:A(a, 0), B(b, 0), C(0, c) and D(0, d), 
with 0 < a < b and 0 < c < d.
Point P, also with integer coordinates, is chosen on the line AC so that the three triangles ABP, CDP and BDP are all similar.

It is easy to prove that the three triangles can be similar, only if a=c.
So, given that a=c, we are looking for triplets (a,b,d) such that at least one point P (with integer coordinates) exists on AC, making the three triangles ABP, CDP and BDP all similar.
For example, if (a,b,d)=(2,3,4), it can be easily verified that point P(1,1) satisfies the above condition. 
Note that the triplets (2,3,4) and (2,4,3) are considered as distinct, although point P(1,1) is common for both.
If b+d < 100, there are 92 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that point P exists.
If b+d < 100 000, there are 320471 distinct triplets (a,b,d) such that point P exists.

300,Protein folding,Problem 300,"
In a very simplified form, we can consider proteins as strings consisting of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P) elements, e.g. HHPPHHHPHHPH. 
For this problem, the orientation of a protein is important; e.g. HPP is considered distinct from PPH. Thus, there are 2n distinct proteins consisting of n elements.
When one encounters these strings in nature, they are always folded in such a way that the number of H-H contact points is as large as possible, since this is energetically advantageous.
As a result, the H-elements tend to accumulate in the inner part, with the P-elements on the outside.
Natural proteins are folded in three dimensions of course, but we will only consider protein folding in two dimensions.
The figure below shows two possible ways that our example protein could be folded (H-H contact points are shown with red dots).

The folding on the left has only six H-H contact points, thus it would never occur naturally.
On the other hand, the folding on the right has nine H-H contact points, which is optimal for this string.
Assuming that H and P elements are equally likely to occur in any position along the string, the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length 8 turns out to be 850 / 28=3.3203125.
What is the average number of H-H contact points in an optimal folding of a random protein string of length 15?

301,Nim,Problem 301,"
Nim is a game played with heaps of stones, where two players take it in turn to remove any number of stones from any heap until no stones remain.
We'll consider the three-heap normal-play version of Nim, which works as follows:
At the start of the game there are three heaps of stones.
On each player's turn, the player may remove any positive number of stones from any single heap.
The first player unable to move (because no stones remain) loses.
If (n1,n2,n3) indicates a Nim position consisting of heaps of size n1, n2, and n3, then there is a simple function, which you may look up or attempt to deduce for yourself, X(n1,n2,n3) that returns:
zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually lose; or
non-zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually win.
For example X(1,2,3)=0 because, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can respond with a move that leaves two heaps of equal size, at which point every move by the current player can be mirrored by the opponent until no stones remain; so the current player loses. To illustrate:
current player moves to (1,2,1)
opponent moves to (1,0,1)
current player moves to (0,0,1)
opponent moves to (0,0,0), and so wins.

306,Paper-strip Game,Problem 306,"
The following game is a classic example of Combinatorial Game Theory:
Two players start with a strip of n white squares and they take alternate turns.
On each turn, a player picks two contiguous white squares and paints them black.
The first player who cannot make a move loses.
n=1: No valid moves, so the first player loses automatically.
n=2: Only one valid move, after which the second player loses.
n=3: Two valid moves, but both leave a situation where the second player loses.
n=4: Three valid moves for the first player, who is able to win the game by painting the two middle squares.
n=5: Four valid moves for the first player (shown below in red), but no matter what the player does, the second player (blue) wins.

So, for 1≤n≤5, there are 3 values of n for which the first player can force a win.
Similarly, for 1≤n≤50, there are 40 values of n for which the first player can force a win.
For 1≤n≤1000000, how many values of n are there for which the first player can force a win?

308,An amazing Prime-generating Automaton,Problem 308,"
A program written in the programming language Fractran consists of a list of fractions.
The internal state of the Fractran Virtual Machine is a positive integer, which is initially set to a seed value. Each iteration of a Fractran program multiplies the state integer by the first fraction in the list which will leave it an integer.
For example, one of the Fractran programs that John Horton Conway wrote for prime-generation consists of the following 14 fractions:
1791,7885,1951,2338,2933,7729,9523,7719,117,1113,1311,152,17,551
Starting with the seed integer 2, successive iterations of the program produce the sequence:
15, 825, 725, 1925, 2275, 425, ..., 68, 4, 30, ..., 136, 8, 60, ..., 544, 32, 240, ...
The powers of 2 that appear in this sequence are 22, 23, 25, ...
It can be shown that all the powers of 2 in this sequence have prime exponents and that all the primes appear as exponents of powers of 2, in proper order!
If someone uses the above Fractran program to solve Project Euler Problem 7 (find the 10001st prime), how many iterations would be needed until the program produces 210001st prime ?

The wall must be a closed series of straight lines, each line running from post to post.


The bigger countries of course have built a 2000 m wall enclosing the entire 250 000 m2 area. The Duchy of Grand Fenwick, has a tighter budget, and has asked you (their Royal Programmer) to compute what shape would get best maximum enclosed-area/wall-length ratio.


You have done some preliminary calculations on a sheet of paper.
For a 2000 meter wall enclosing the 250 000 m2 area the
enclosed-area/wall-length ratio is 125.
Although not allowed , but to get an idea if this is anything better:  if you place a circle inside the square area touching the four sides the area will be equal to π*2502 m2 and the perimeter will be π*500 m, so the enclosed-area/wall-length ratio will also be 125.


However, if you cut off from the square four triangles with sides 75 m, 75 m and 75√2 m the total area becomes 238750 m2 and the perimeter becomes 1400+300√2 m. So this gives an enclosed-area/wall-length ratio of 130.87, which is significantly better.

315,Digital root clocks,Problem 315,"

Sam and Max are asked to transform two digital clocks into two ""digital root"" clocks.
A digital root clock is a digital clock that calculates digital roots step by step.
When a clock is fed a number, it will show it and then it will start the calculation, showing all the intermediate values until it gets to the result.
For example, if the clock is fed the number 137, it will show: ""137"" → ""11"" → ""2"" and then it will go black, waiting for the next number.
Every digital number consists of some light segments: three horizontal (top, middle, bottom) and four vertical (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right).
Number ""1"" is made of vertical top-right and bottom-right, number ""4"" is made by middle horizontal and vertical top-left, top-right and bottom-right. Number ""8"" lights them all.
The clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.
To turn on a ""2"" will cost 5 transitions, while a ""7"" will cost only 4 transitions.
Sam and Max built two different clocks.
Sam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows ""137"", then the panel is turned off, then the next number (""11"") is turned on, then the panel is turned off again and finally the last number (""2"") is turned on and, after some time, off.
For the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:""137""
:
(2 + 5 + 4) × 2 = 22 transitions (""137"" on/off).
""11""
:
(2 + 2) × 2 = 8 transitions (""11"" on/off).
""2""
:
(5) × 2 = 10 transitions (""2"" on/off).

For a grand total of 40 transitions.

Max's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for the next number.
For number 137, Max's clock requires:""137""
:
2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions (""137"" on)
7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for number ""11"").
""11""
:
0 transitions (number ""11"" is already turned on correctly)
3 transitions (to turn off the first ""1"" and the bottom part of the second ""1""; 
the top part is common with number ""2"").
""2""
:
4 transitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a ""2"")
5 transitions (to turn off number ""2"").

For a grand total of 30 transitions.

Of course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one.
The two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 107 and B = 2×107. 
Find the difference between the total number of transitions needed by Sam's clock and that needed by Max's one.

Let p = p1 p2 p3 ... be an infinite sequence of random digits, selected from {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with equal probability.
It can be seen that p corresponds to the real number 0.p1 p2 p3 .... 
It can also be seen that choosing a random real number from the interval [0,1) is equivalent to choosing an infinite sequence of random digits selected from {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9} with equal probability.
For any positive integer n with d decimal digits, let k be the smallest index such that pk, pk+1, ...pk+d-1 are the decimal digits of n, in the same order.
Also, let g(n) be the expected value of k; it can be proven that g(n) is always finite and, interestingly, always an integer number.
For example, if n = 535, then
for p = 31415926535897...., we get k = 9
for p = 355287143650049560000490848764084685354..., we get k = 36

327,Rooms of Doom,Problem 327,"
A series of three rooms are connected to each other by automatic doors.

Each door is operated by a security card. Once you enter a room the door automatically closes and that security card cannot be used again. A machine at the start will dispense an unlimited number of cards, but each room (including the starting room) contains scanners and if they detect that you are holding more than three security cards or if they detect an unattended security card on the floor, then all the doors will become permanently locked. However, each room contains a box where you may safely store any number of security cards for use at a later stage.
If you simply tried to travel through the rooms one at a time then as you entered room 3 you would have used all three cards and would be trapped in that room forever!
However, if you make use of the storage boxes, then escape is possible. For example, you could enter room 1 using your first card, place one card in the storage box, and use your third card to exit the room back to the start. Then after collecting three more cards from the dispensing machine you could use one to enter room 1 and collect the card you placed in the box a moment ago. You now have three cards again and will be able to travel through the remaining three doors. This method allows you to travel through all three rooms using six security cards in total.
It is possible to travel through six rooms using a total of 123 security cards while carrying a maximum of 3 cards.
Let C be the maximum number of cards which can be carried at any time.

<p>Each door is operated by a security card. Once you enter a room the door automatically closes and that security card cannot be used again. A machine at the start will dispense an unlimited number of cards, but each room (including the starting room) contains scanners and if they detect that you are holding more than three security cards or if they detect an unattended security card on the floor, then all the doors will become permanently locked. However, each room contains a box where you may safely store any number of security cards for use at a later stage.</p>

<p>If you simply tried to travel through the rooms one at a time then as you entered room 3 you would have used all three cards and would be trapped in that room forever!</p>

<p>However, if you make use of the storage boxes, then escape is possible. For example, you could enter room 1 using your first card, place one card in the storage box, and use your third card to exit the room back to the start. Then after collecting three more cards from the dispensing machine you could use one to enter room 1 and collect the card you placed in the box a moment ago. You now have three cards again and will be able to travel through the remaining three doors. This method allows you to travel through all three rooms using six security cards in total.</p>

328,Lowest-cost Search,Problem 328,"
We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2, ..., n} by asking questions. 
Each number (question) we ask, has a cost equal to the number asked and we get one of three possible answers: ""Your guess is lower than the hidden number"", or
 ""Yes, that's it!"", or
 ""Your guess is higher than the hidden number"".
Given the value of n, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost (i.e. the sum of all the questions asked) for the worst possible case. E.g.
If n=3, the best we can do is obviously to ask the number ""2"". The answer will immediately lead us to find the hidden number (at a total cost = 2).
If n=8, we might decide to use a ""binary search"" type of strategy: Our first question would be ""4"" and if the hidden number is higher than 4 we will need one or two additional questions.
Let our second question be ""6"". If the hidden number is still higher than 6, we will need a third question in order to discriminate between 7 and 8.
Thus, our third question will be ""7"" and the total cost for this worst-case scenario will be 4+6+7=17.
We can improve considerably the worst-case cost for n=8, by asking ""5"" as our first question.
If we are told that the hidden number is higher than 5, our second question will be ""7"", then we'll know for certain what the hidden number is (for a total cost of 5+7=12).
If we are told that the hidden number is lower than 5, our second question will be ""3"" and if the hidden number is lower than 3 our third question will be ""1"", giving a total cost of 5+3+1=9.
Since 12>9, the worst-case cost for this strategy is 12. That's better than what we achieved previously with the ""binary search"" strategy; it is also better than or equal to any other strategy.
So, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for n=8.
Let C(n) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for n, as described above.
Thus C(1) = 0, C(2) = 1, C(3) = 2 and C(8) = 12.
Similarly, C(100) = 400 and ∑n=1100C(n)=17575.

He can only jump one square to the left or to the right, with equal probability, and he cannot jump outside the range [1;500].(if it lands at either end, it automatically jumps to the only available square on the next move.)


When he is on a square with a prime number on it, he croaks 'P' (PRIME) with probability 2/3 or 'N' (NOT PRIME) with probability 1/3 just before jumping to the next square.
When he is on a square with a number on it that is not a prime he croaks 'P' with probability 1/3 or 'N' with probability 2/3 just before jumping to the next square.


Given that the frog's starting position is random with the same probability for every square, and given that she listens to his first 15 croaks, what is the probability that she hears the sequence PPPPNNPPPNPPNPN?

For example, the partition of 17 = 2 + 6 + 9 = (21x30 + 21x31 + 20x32) would not be valid since 2 can divide 6. Neither would the partition 17 = 16 + 1 = (24x30 + 20x30) since 1 can divide 16. The only valid partition of 17 would be 8 + 9 = (23x30 + 20x32).
Many integers have more than one valid partition, the first being 11 having the following two partitions.
11 = 2 + 9 = (21x30 + 20x32)

A train is used to transport four carriages in the order: ABCD. However, sometimes when the train arrives to collect the carriages they are not in the correct order. 
To rearrange the carriages they are all shunted on to a large rotating turntable. After the carriages are uncoupled at a specific point the train moves off the turntable pulling the carriages still attached with it. The remaining carriages are rotated 180 degrees. All of the carriages are then rejoined and this process is repeated as often as necessary in order to obtain the least number of uses of the turntable.
Some arrangements, such as ADCB, can be solved easily: the carriages are separated between A and D, and after DCB are rotated the correct order has been achieved.
However, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his efficiency, so he always solves the problem by initially getting carriage A in the correct place, then carriage B, and so on.
Using four carriages, the worst possible arrangements for Simon, which we shall call maximix arrangements, are DACB and DBAC; each requiring him five rotations (although, using the most efficient approach, they could be solved using just three rotations). The process he uses for DACB is shown below.

It can be verified that there are 24 maximix arrangements for six carriages, of which the tenth lexicographic maximix arrangement is DFAECB.

<p>However, Simple Simon, the train driver, is not known for his efficiency, so he always solves the problem by initially getting carriage A in the correct place, then carriage B, and so on.</p>

<p>Using four carriages, the worst possible arrangements for Simon, which we shall call <i>maximix arrangements</i>, are DACB and DBAC; each requiring him five rotations (although, using the most efficient approach, they could be solved using just three rotations). The process he uses for DACB is shown below.</p>

338,Cutting Rectangular Grid Paper,Problem 338,"
A rectangular sheet of grid paper with integer dimensions w × h is given. Its grid spacing is 1.
When we cut the sheet along the grid lines into two pieces and rearrange those pieces without overlap, we can make new rectangles with different dimensions.
For example, from a sheet with dimensions 9 × 4 , we can make rectangles with dimensions 18 × 2, 12 × 3 and 6 × 6 by cutting and rearranging as below:


Similarly, from a sheet with dimensions 9 × 8 , we can make rectangles with dimensions 18 × 4 and 12 × 6 .
For a pair w and h, let F(w,h) be the number of distinct rectangles that can be made from a sheet with dimensions w × h .
For example, F(2,1) = 0, F(2,2) = 1, F(9,4) = 3 and F(9,8) = 2. 
Note that rectangles congruent to the initial one are not counted in F(w,h).
Note also that rectangles with dimensions w × h and dimensions h × w are not considered distinct.
For an integer N, let G(N) be the sum of F(w,h) for all pairs w and h which satisfy 0 < h ≤ w ≤ N.
We can verify that G(10) = 55, G(103) = 971745 and G(105) = 9992617687.

One variant of N.G. de Bruijn's silver dollar game can be described as follows:
On a strip of squares a number of coins are placed, at most one coin per square. Only one coin, called the silver dollar, has any value. Two players take turns making moves. At each turn a player must make either a regular or a special move.
A regular move consists of selecting one coin and moving it one or more squares to the left. The coin cannot move out of the strip or jump on or over another coin.
Alternatively, the player can choose to make the special move of pocketing the leftmost coin rather than making a regular move. If no regular moves are possible, the player is forced to pocket the leftmost coin.
The winner is the player who pockets the silver dollar.


A winning configuration is an arrangement of coins on the strip where the first player can force a win no matter what the second player does.

352,Blood tests,Problem 352,"

Each one of the 25 sheep in a flock must be tested for a rare virus, known to affect 2% of the sheep population.
An accurate and extremely sensitive PCR test exists for blood samples, producing a clear positive / negative result, but it is very time-consuming and expensive.


Because of the high cost, the vet-in-charge suggests that instead of performing 25 separate tests, the following procedure can be used instead:
The sheep are split into 5 groups of 5 sheep in each group. 
For each group, the 5 samples are mixed together and a single test is performed. Then,
If the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be virus-free.
If the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).

Since the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:
Negative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.985 = 0.9039207968.
Positive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032.

Thus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 × 5 = 1.480396016.
Consequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only 1.480396016 × 5 = 7.40198008 tests, which represents a huge saving of more than 70% !


Although the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:
We may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It can be verified that in about 60.35% of the cases this test will be negative, thus no more tests will be needed. Further testing will only be required for the remaining 39.65% of the cases.
If we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected and the first 4 individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).
We can try a different number of groups / different number of animals in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total expected number of tests will be minimised.

To simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.

For the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing scheme (we'll call it the optimal strategy) requires an average of just 4.155452 tests!



Using the optimal strategy, let T(s,p) represent the average number of tests needed to screen a flock of s sheep for a virus having probability p to be present in any individual.
Thus, rounded to six decimal places, T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452 and T(25, 0.10) = 12.702124.


Find ∑ T(10000, p) for p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.50.

359,Hilbert's New Hotel,Problem 359,"

An infinite number of people (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.) are lined up to get a room at Hilbert's newest infinite hotel. The hotel contains an infinite number of floors (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.), and each floor contains an infinite number of rooms (numbered 1, 2, 3, etc.). 


Initially the hotel is empty. Hilbert declares a rule on how the nth person is assigned a room: person n gets the first vacant room in the lowest numbered floor satisfying either of the following:
the floor is empty
the floor is not empty, and if the latest person taking a room in that floor is person m, then m + n is a perfect square

Person 1 gets room 1 in floor 1 since floor 1 is empty.
Person 2 does not get room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 2 = 3 is not a perfect square.
Person 2 instead gets room 1 in floor 2 since floor 2 is empty.
Person 3 gets room 2 in floor 1 since 1 + 3 = 4 is a perfect square.


Eventually, every person in the line gets a room in the hotel.


Define P(f, r) to be n if person n occupies room r in floor f, and 0 if no person occupies the room. Here are a few examples:
P(1, 1) = 1
P(1, 2) = 3
P(2, 1) = 2

On the segments P0P1, P1P2, and P2P3 the points Q0,Q1, and Q2 are drawn such that P0Q0P0P1=P1Q1P1P2=P2Q2P2P3=t, with t in [0,1].

Q0R0Q0Q1=Q1R1Q1Q2=t for the same value of t.
On the segment R0R1 the point B is drawn such that R0BR0R1=t for the same value of t.
The Bézier curve defined by the points P0,P1,P2,P3 is the locus of B as Q0 takes all possible positions on the segment P0P1.

An integer partition of a number n is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers.
Partitions that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same.
A partition of n into distinct parts is a partition of n in which every part occurs at most once.
The partitions of 5 into distinct parts are:
5, 4+1 and 3+2.
Let f(n) be the maximum product of the parts of any such partition of n into distinct parts and let m(n) be the number of elements of any such partition of n with that product.
So f(5)=6 and m(5)=2.
For n=10 the partition with the largest product is 10=2+3+5, which gives f(10)=30 and m(10)=3.

A game is played by two players picking a die in turn and rolling it. The player who rolls the highest value wins.

385,Ellipses inside triangles,Problem 385,"

For any triangle T in the plane, it can be shown that there is a unique ellipse with largest area that is completely inside T.



For a given n, consider triangles T such that:
- the vertices of T have integer coordinates with absolute value ≤ n, and 
- the foci1 of the largest-area ellipse inside T are (√13,0) and (-√13,0).
Let A(n) be the sum of the areas of all such triangles.


For example, if n = 8, there are two such triangles. Their vertices are (-4,-3),(-4,3),(8,0) and (4,3),(4,-3),(-8,0), and the area of each triangle is 36. Thus A(8) = 36 + 36 = 72.

The Pythagorean tree is a fractal generated by the following procedure:


Start with a unit square. Then, calling one of the sides its base (in the animation, the bottom side is the base):
 Attach a right triangle to the side opposite the base, with the hypotenuse coinciding with that side and with the sides in a 3-4-5 ratio. Note that the smaller side of the triangle must be on the 'right' side with respect to the base (see animation).
 Attach a square to each leg of the right triangle, with one of its sides coinciding with that leg.

396,Weak Goodstein sequence,Problem 396,"

For any positive integer n, the nth weak Goodstein sequence {g1, g2, g3, ...} is defined as:
 g1 = n
 for k > 1, gk is obtained by writing gk-1 in base k, interpreting it as a base k + 1 number, and subtracting 1.

The sequence terminates when gk becomes 0.


For example, the 6th weak Goodstein sequence is {6, 11, 17, 25, ...}:
 g1 = 6.
 g2 = 11 since 6 = 1102, 1103 = 12, and 12 - 1 = 11.
 g3 = 17 since 11 = 1023, 1024 = 18, and 18 - 1 = 17.
 g4 = 25 since 17 = 1014, 1015 = 26, and 26 - 1 = 25.

We are trying to find a hidden number selected from the set of integers {1, 2, ..., n} by asking questions. 
Each number (question) we ask, we get one of three possible answers: ""Your guess is lower than the hidden number"" (and you incur a cost of a), or
 ""Your guess is higher than the hidden number"" (and you incur a cost of b), or
 ""Yes, that's it!"" (and the game ends).
Given the value of n, a, and b, an optimal strategy minimizes the total cost for the worst possible case.
For example, if n = 5, a = 2, and b = 3, then we may begin by asking ""2"" as our first question.
If we are told that 2 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of b=3), then we are sure that ""1"" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 3).
If we are told that 2 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2), then our next question will be ""4"".
If we are told that 4 is higher than the hidden number (for a cost of b=3), then we are sure that ""3"" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+3=5).
If we are told that 4 is lower than the hidden number (for a cost of a=2), then we are sure that ""5"" is the hidden number (for a total cost of 2+2=4).
Thus, the worst-case cost achieved by this strategy is 5. It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved.

6174 is a remarkable number; if we sort its digits in increasing order and subtract that number from the number you get when you sort the digits in decreasing order, we get 7641-1467=6174.
Even more remarkable is that if we start from any 4 digit number and repeat this process of sorting and subtracting, we'll eventually end up with 6174 or immediately with 0 if all digits are equal. 
This also works with numbers that have less than 4 digits if we pad the number with leading zeroes until we have 4 digits.
E.g. let's start with the number 0837:
8730-0378=8352
8532-2358=6174


6174 is called the Kaprekar constant. The process of sorting and subtracting and repeating this until either 0 or the Kaprekar constant is reached is called the Kaprekar routine.


We can consider the Kaprekar routine for other bases and number of digits. 
Unfortunately, it is not guaranteed a Kaprekar constant exists in all cases; either the routine can end up in a cycle for some input numbers or the constant the routine arrives at can be different for different input numbers.
However, it can be shown that for 5 digits and a base b = 6t+3≠9, a Kaprekar constant exists.
E.g. base 15: (10,4,14,9,5)15
base 21: (14,6,20,13,7)21

Define Cb to be the Kaprekar constant in base b for 5 digits.
Define the function sb(i) to be
 0 if i = Cb or if i written in base b consists of 5 identical digits
 the number of iterations it takes the Kaprekar routine in base b to arrive at Cb, otherwise

Note that we can define sb(i) for all integers i < b5. If i written in base b takes less than 5 digits, the number is padded with leading zero digits until we have 5 digits before applying the Kaprekar routine.


Define S(b) as the sum of sb(i) for 0 < i < b5.

X = Gray cell, not required to be filled by a digit.
O (upper case letter)= White empty cell to be filled by a digit.
A = Or any one of the upper case letters from A to J to be replaced by its equivalent digit in the solved puzzle.
( ) = Location of the encrypted sums. Horizontal sums are preceded by a lower case ""h"" and vertical sums are preceded by a lower case ""v"". Those are followed by one or two upper case letters depending if the sum is a single digit or double digit one. For double digit sums, the first letter would be for the ""tens"" and the second one for the ""units"". When the cell must contain information for both a horizontal and a vertical sum, the first one is always for the horizontal sum and the two are separated by a comma within the same set of brackets, ex.: (hFE,vD). Each set of brackets is also immediately followed by a comma.
The description of the last cell is followed by a Carriage Return/Line Feed (CRLF) instead of a comma.

For example, an initial configuration of 2 consecutive occupied boxes followed by 2 empty boxes, 2 occupied boxes, 1 empty box, and 2 occupied boxes can be denoted by the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2), in which the number of consecutive occupied and empty boxes appear alternately.


A turn consists of moving each ball exactly once according to the following rule: Transfer the leftmost ball which has not been moved to the nearest empty box to its right.


After one turn the sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 2) becomes (2, 2, 1, 2, 3) as can be seen below; note that we begin the new sequence starting at the first occupied box.




A system like this is called a Box-Ball System or BBS for short.


It can be shown that after a sufficient number of turns, the system evolves to a state where the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes is invariant. In the example below, the consecutive numbers of occupied boxes evolves to [1, 2, 3]; we shall call this the final state.




We define the sequence {ti}:s0 = 290797
sk+1 = sk2 mod 50515093
tk = (sk mod 64) + 1

Starting from the initial configuration (t0, t1, …, t10), the final state becomes [1, 3, 10, 24, 51, 75].
Starting from the initial configuration (t0, t1, …, t10 000 000), find the final state.
Give as your answer the sum of the squares of the elements of the final state. For example, if the final state is [1, 2, 3] then 14 ( = 12 + 22 + 32) is your answer.

431,Square Space Silo,Problem 431,"
Fred the farmer arranges to have a new storage silo installed on his farm and having an obsession for all things square he is absolutely devastated when he discovers that it is circular. Quentin, the representative from the company that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on a square base. Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.
Quick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of repose, α=30 degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of 6m, the amount of space wasted would be approximately 32.648388556 m3. However, if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has a horizontal distance of x metres from the centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is formed. He shows Fred a picture.


We shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by V(x). If x=1.114785284, which happens to have three squared decimal places, then the amount of space wasted, V(1.114785284)≈36. Given the range of possible solutions to this problem there is exactly one other option: V(2.511167869)≈49. It would be like knowing that the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your grain.
Fred's eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on closer inspection of Quentin's drawings and calculations his happiness turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it's the radius of the silo that is 6 metres, not the diameter, and the angle of repose for his grain is 40 degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it.
If Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of x for all possible square space wastage options and calculate ∑x correct to 9 decimal places.

Recall that a graph is a collection of vertices and edges connecting the vertices, and that two vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent.
Graphs can be embedded in Euclidean space by associating each vertex with a point in the Euclidean space.
A flexible graph is an embedding of a graph where it is possible to move one or more vertices continuously so that the distance between at least two nonadjacent vertices is altered while the distances between each pair of adjacent vertices is kept constant.
A rigid graph is an embedding of a graph which is not flexible.
Informally, a graph is rigid if by replacing the vertices with fully rotating hinges and the edges with rods that are unbending and inelastic, no parts of the graph can be moved independently from the rest of the graph.

The grid graphs embedded in the Euclidean plane are not rigid, as the following animation demonstrates:

However, one can make them rigid by adding diagonal edges to the cells. For example, for the 2x3 grid graph, there are 19 ways to make the graph rigid:

Note that for the purposes of this problem, we do not consider changing the orientation of a diagonal edge or adding both diagonal edges to a cell as a different way of making a grid graph rigid.

437,Fibonacci primitive roots,Problem 437,"

When we calculate 8n modulo 11 for n=0 to 9 we get: 1, 8, 9, 6, 4, 10, 3, 2, 5, 7.
As we see all possible values from 1 to 10 occur. So 8 is a primitive root of 11.
But there is more:
If we take a closer look we see:
1+8=9
8+9=17≡6 mod 11
9+6=15≡4 mod 11
6+4=10

10+3=13≡2 mod 11
3+2=5
2+5=7
5+7=12≡1 mod 11.

So the powers of 8 mod 11 are cyclic with period 10, and 8n + 8n+1 ≡ 8n+2 (mod 11).
8 is called a Fibonacci primitive root of 11.
Not every prime has a Fibonacci primitive root.
There are 323 primes less than 10000 with one or more Fibonacci primitive roots and the sum of these primes is 1480491.

Each ticket, when scratched, reveals a whole-pound prize ranging anywhere from £1 to £p, with no two tickets alike. The goal of the game is for all of the players to maximize the winnings of the ticket they hold upon leaving the game.
An arbitrary person is chosen to be the first player. Going around the table, each player has only one of two options:
The player can choose to scratch the ticket and reveal its worth to everyone at the table.
If the player's ticket is unscratched, then the player may trade it with a previous player's scratched ticket, and then leaves the game with that ticket. The previous player then scratches the newly-acquired ticket and reveals its worth to everyone at the table.
The game ends once all tickets have been scratched. All players still remaining at the table must leave with their currently-held tickets.
Assume that players will use the optimal strategy for maximizing the expected value of their ticket winnings.

460,An ant on the move,Problem 460,"

On the Euclidean plane, an ant travels from point A(0, 1) to point B(d, 1) for an integer d.


In each step, the ant at point (x0, y0) chooses one of the lattice points (x1, y1) which satisfy x1 ≥ 0 and y1 ≥ 1 and goes straight to (x1, y1) at a constant velocity v. The value of v depends on y0 and y1 as follows:
 If y0 = y1, the value of v equals y0.
 If y0 ≠ y1, the value of v equals (y1 - y0) / (ln(y1) - ln(y0)).

The left image is one of the possible paths for d = 4. First the ant goes from A(0, 1) to P1(1, 3) at velocity (3 - 1) / (ln(3) - ln(1)) ≈ 1.8205. Then the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 ≈ 1.2283.
From P1(1, 3) to P2(3, 3) the ant travels at velocity 3 so the required time is 2 / 3 ≈ 0.6667. From P2(3, 3) to B(4, 1) the ant travels at velocity (1 - 3) / (ln(1) - ln(3)) ≈ 1.8205 so the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 ≈ 1.2283.
Thus the total required time is 1.2283 + 0.6667 + 1.2283 = 3.1233.


The right image is another path. The total required time is calculated as 0.98026 + 1 + 0.98026 = 2.96052. It can be shown that this is the quickest path for d = 4.



Let F(d) be the total required time if the ant chooses the quickest path. For example, F(4) ≈ 2.960516287.
We can verify that F(10) ≈ 4.668187834 and F(100) ≈ 9.217221972.

From P<sub>1</sub>(1, 3) to P<sub>2</sub>(3, 3) the ant travels at velocity 3 so the required time is 2 / 3 ≈ 0.6667. From P<sub>2</sub>(3, 3) to B(4, 1) the ant travels at velocity (1 - 3) / (ln(1) - ln(3)) ≈ 1.8205 so the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 ≈ 1.2283.<br />
Thus the total required time is 1.2283 + 0.6667 + 1.2283 = 3.1233.

462,Permutation of 3-smooth numbers,Problem 462,"

A 3-smooth number is an integer which has no prime factor larger than 3. For an integer N, we define S(N) as the set of 3-smooth numbers less than or equal to N . For example, S(20) = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18 }.


We define F(N) as the number of permutations of S(N) in which each element comes after all of its proper divisors.


This is one of the possible permutations for N = 20.
- 1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 8, 16, 6, 18, 12.
This is not a valid permutation because 12 comes before its divisor 6.
- 1, 2, 4, 3, 9, 8, 12, 16, 6, 18.

Find F(1018). Give as your answer its scientific notation rounded to ten digits after the decimal point.
When giving your answer, use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent. E.g. if the answer is 112,233,445,566,778,899 then the answer format would be 1.1223344557e17.

465,Polar polygons,Problem 465,"
The kernel of a polygon is defined by the set of points from which the entire polygon's boundary is visible. We define a polar polygon as a polygon for which the origin is strictly contained inside its kernel.
For this problem, a polygon can have collinear consecutive vertices. However, a polygon still cannot have self-intersection and cannot have zero area.
For example, only the first of the following is a polar polygon (the kernels of the second, third, and fourth do not strictly contain the origin, and the fifth does not have a kernel at all):

Notice that the first polygon has three consecutive collinear vertices.
Let P(n) be the number of polar polygons such that the vertices (x, y) have integer coordinates whose absolute values are not greater than n.
Note that polygons should be counted as different if they have different set of edges, even if they enclose the same area. For example, the polygon with vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0)] is distinct from the polygon with vertices [(0,0),(0,3),(1,1),(3,0),(1,0)].

470,Super Ramvok,Problem 470,"
Consider a single game of Ramvok:
Let t represent the maximum number of turns the game lasts. If t = 0, then the game ends immediately. Otherwise, on each turn i, the player rolls a die. After rolling, if i < t the player can either stop the game and receive a prize equal to the value of the current roll, or discard the roll and try again next turn. If i = t, then the roll cannot be discarded and the prize must be accepted. Before the game begins, t is chosen by the player, who must then pay an up-front cost ct for some constant c. For c = 0, t can be chosen to be infinite (with an up-front cost of 0). Let R(d, c) be the expected profit (i.e. net gain) that the player receives from a single game of optimally-played Ramvok, given a fair d-sided die and cost constant c. For example, R(4, 0.2) = 2.65. Assume that the player has sufficient funds for paying any/all up-front costs.
Now consider a game of Super Ramvok:
In Super Ramvok, the game of Ramvok is played repeatedly, but with a slight modification. After each game, the die is altered. The alteration process is as follows: The die is rolled once, and if the resulting face has its pips visible, then that face is altered to be blank instead. If the face is already blank, then it is changed back to its original value. After the alteration is made, another game of Ramvok can begin (and during such a game, at each turn, the die is rolled until a face with a value on it appears). The player knows which faces are blank and which are not at all times. The game of Super Ramvok ends once all faces of the die are blank.
Let S(d, c) be the expected profit that the player receives from an optimally-played game of Super Ramvok, given a fair d-sided die to start (with all sides visible), and cost constant c. For example, S(6, 1) = 208.3.

","<p>Consider a single game of Ramvok:</p>

<p>Let <var>t</var> represent the maximum number of turns the game lasts. If <var>t</var> = 0, then the game ends immediately. Otherwise, on each turn <var>i</var>, the player rolls a die. After rolling, if <var>i</var> &lt; <var>t</var> the player can either stop the game and receive a prize equal to the value of the current roll, or discard the roll and try again next turn. If <var>i</var> = <var>t</var>, then the roll cannot be discarded and the prize must be accepted. Before the game begins, <var>t</var> is chosen by the player, who must then pay an up-front cost <var>ct</var> for some constant <var>c</var>. For <var>c</var> = 0, <var>t</var> can be chosen to be infinite (with an up-front cost of 0). Let R(<var>d</var>, <var>c</var>) be the expected profit (i.e. net gain) that the player receives from a single game of optimally-played Ramvok, given a fair <var>d</var>-sided die and cost constant <var>c</var>.

<p>Now consider a game of Super Ramvok:</p>

<p>In Super Ramvok, the game of Ramvok is played repeatedly, but with a slight modification. After each game, the die is altered. The alteration process is as follows: The die is rolled once, and if the resulting face has its pips visible, then that face is altered to be blank instead. If the face is already blank, then it is changed back to its original value. After the alteration is made, another game of Ramvok can begin (and during such a game, at each turn, the die is rolled until a face with a value on it appears). The player knows which faces are blank and which are not at all times. The game of Super Ramvok ends once all faces of the die are blank.</p>

There are N seats in a row. N people come one after another to fill the seats according to the following rules:
No person sits beside another.
The first person chooses any seat.
Each subsequent person chooses the seat furthest from anyone else already seated, as long as it does not violate rule 1. If there is more than one choice satisfying this condition, then the person chooses the leftmost choice.

Here are the possible seating arrangements for N = 15:

Let φ be the golden ratio: φ=1+52.
Remarkably it is possible to write every positive integer as a sum of powers of φ even if we require that every power of φ is used at most once in this sum.
Even then this representation is not unique.
We can make it unique by requiring that no powers with consecutive exponents are used and that the representation is finite.
E.g: 
2=φ+φ−2 and 3=φ2+φ−2


To represent this sum of powers of φ we use a string of 0's and 1's with a point to indicate where the negative exponents start.
We call this the representation in the phigital numberbase.
So 1=1φ, 2=10.01φ, 3=100.01φ and 14=100100.001001φ. 
The strings representing 1, 2 and 14 in the phigital number base are palindromic, while the string representing 3 is not. (the phigital point is not the middle character).

478,Mixtures,Problem 478,"
Let us consider mixtures of three substances: A, B and C. A mixture can be described by a ratio of the amounts of A, B, and C in it, i.e., (a : b : c). For example, a mixture described by the ratio (2 : 3 : 5) contains 20% A, 30% B and 50% C.
For the purposes of this problem, we cannot separate the individual components from a mixture. However, we can combine different amounts of different mixtures to form mixtures with new ratios.
For example, say we have three mixtures with ratios (3 : 0 : 2), (3 : 6 : 11) and (3 : 3 : 4). By mixing 10 units of the first, 20 units of the second and 30 units of the third, we get a new mixture with ratio (6 : 5 : 9), since:
(10·3/5 + 20·3/20 + 30·3/10 : 10·0/5 + 20·6/20 + 30·3/10 : 10·2/5 + 20·11/20 + 30·4/10)
= (18 : 15 : 27) = (6 : 5 : 9)
However, with the same three mixtures, it is impossible to form the ratio (3 : 2 : 1), since the amount of B is always less than the amount of C.
Let n be a positive integer. Suppose that for every triple of integers (a, b, c) with 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ n and gcd(a, b, c) = 1, we have a mixture with ratio (a : b : c). Let M(n) be the set of all such mixtures.
For example, M(2) contains the 19 mixtures with the following ratios:
{(0 : 0 : 1), (0 : 1 : 0), (0 : 1 : 1), (0 : 1 : 2), (0 : 2 : 1),

(2 : 1 : 0), (2 : 1 : 1), (2 : 1 : 2), (2 : 2 : 1)}.
Let E(n) be the number of subsets of M(n) which can produce the mixture with ratio (1 : 1 : 1), i.e., the mixture with equal parts A, B and C. 
We can verify that E(1) = 103, E(2) = 520447, E(10) mod 118 = 82608406 and E(500) mod 118 = 13801403.

481,Chef Showdown,Problem 481,"
A group of chefs (numbered #1, #2, etc) participate in a turn-based strategic cooking competition. On each chef's turn, he/she cooks up a dish to the best of his/her ability and gives it to a separate panel of judges for taste-testing. Let S(k) represent chef #k's skill level (which is publicly known). More specifically, S(k) is the probability that chef #k's dish will be assessed favorably by the judges (on any/all turns). If the dish receives a favorable rating, then the chef must choose one other chef to be eliminated from the competition. The last chef remaining in the competition is the winner.
The game always begins with chef #1, with the turn order iterating sequentially over the rest of the chefs still in play. Then the cycle repeats from the lowest-numbered chef. All chefs aim to optimize their chances of winning within the rules as stated, assuming that the other chefs behave in the same manner. In the event that a chef has more than one equally-optimal elimination choice, assume that the chosen chef is always the one with the next-closest turn.
Define Wn(k) as the probability that chef #k wins in a competition with n chefs. If we have S(1) = 0.25, S(2) = 0.5, and S(3) = 1, then W3(1) = 0.29375.
Going forward, we assign S(k) = Fk/Fn+1 over all 1 ≤ k ≤ n, where Fk is a Fibonacci number: Fk = Fk-1 + Fk-2 with base cases F1 = F2 = 1. Then, for example, when considering a competition with n = 7 chefs, we have W7(1) = 0.08965042, W7(2) = 0.20775702, W7(3) = 0.15291406, W7(4) = 0.14554098, W7(5) = 0.15905291, W7(6) = 0.10261412, and W7(7) = 0.14247050, rounded to 8 decimal places each.
Let E(n) represent the expected number of dishes cooked in a competition with n chefs. For instance, E(7) = 42.28176050.

483,Repeated permutation,Problem 483,"

We define a permutation as an operation that rearranges the order of the elements {1, 2, 3, ..., n}.
There are n! such permutations, one of which leaves the elements in their initial order.
For n = 3 we have 3! = 6 permutations:
- P1 = keep the initial order
- P2 = exchange the 1st and 2nd elements
- P3 = exchange the 1st and 3rd elements
- P4 = exchange the 2nd and 3rd elements
- P5 = rotate the elements to the right
- P6 = rotate the elements to the left


If we select one of these permutations, and we re-apply the same permutation repeatedly, we eventually restore the initial order.For a permutation Pi, let f(Pi) be the number of steps required to restore the initial order by applying the permutation Pi repeatedly.For n = 3, we obtain:- f(P1) = 1 : (1,2,3) → (1,2,3)- f(P2) = 2 : (1,2,3) → (2,1,3) → (1,2,3)- f(P3) = 2 : (1,2,3) → (3,2,1) → (1,2,3)- f(P4) = 2 : (1,2,3) → (1,3,2) → (1,2,3)- f(P5) = 3 : (1,2,3) → (3,1,2) → (2,3,1) → (1,2,3)- f(P6) = 3 : (1,2,3) → (2,3,1) → (3,1,2) → (1,2,3)

Alice and Bob have enjoyed playing Nim every day. However, they finally got bored of playing ordinary three-heap Nim.
So, they added an extra rule:
- Must not make two heaps of the same size.
The triple (a,b,c) indicates the size of three heaps.
Under this extra rule, (2,4,5) is one of the losing positions for the next player.
To illustrate:
- Alice moves to (2,4,3)
- Bob   moves to (0,4,3)
- Alice moves to (0,2,3)
- Bob   moves to (0,2,1)
Unlike ordinary three-heap Nim, (0,1,2) and its permutations are the end states of this game.
For an integer N, we define F(N) as the sum of a+b+c for all the losing positions for the next player, with 0 < a < b < c < N.
For example, F(8) = 42, because there are 4 losing positions for the next player, (1,3,5), (1,4,6), (2,3,6) and (2,4,5).

A frog sits on stone 1. He wishes to visit each stone exactly once, stopping on stone n. However, he can only jump from one stone to another if they are at most 3 units apart. In other words, from stone i, he can reach a stone j if 1 ≤ j ≤ n and j is in the set {i-3, i-2, i-1, i+1, i+2, i+3}.

Bob is very familiar with the famous mathematical puzzle/game, ""Tower of Hanoi,"" which consists of three upright rods and disks of different sizes that can slide onto any of the rods. The game begins with a stack of n disks placed on the leftmost rod in descending order by size. The objective of the game is to move all of the disks from the leftmost rod to the rightmost rod, given the following restrictions:
Only one disk can be moved at a time.
A valid move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and placing it onto another stack (or an empty rod).
No disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk.
Moving on to a variant of this game, consider a long room k units (square tiles) wide, labeled from 1 to k in ascending order. Three rods are placed at squares a, b, and c, and a stack of n disks is placed on the rod at square a.
Bob begins the game standing at square b. His objective is to play the Tower of Hanoi game by moving all of the disks to the rod at square c. However, Bob can only pick up or set down a disk if he is on the same square as the rod / stack in question.
Unfortunately, Bob is also drunk. On a given move, Bob will either stumble one square to the left or one square to the right with equal probability, unless Bob is at either end of the room, in which case he can only move in one direction. Despite Bob's inebriated state, he is still capable of following the rules of the game itself, as well as choosing when to pick up or put down a disk.
The following animation depicts a side-view of a sample game for n = 3, k = 7, a = 2, b = 4, and c = 6:

Let E(n,k,a,b,c) be the expected number of squares that Bob travels during a single optimally-played game. A game is played optimally if the number of disk-pickups is minimized.

We define a block to be a rectangle with a height of 1 and an integer-valued length. Let a castle be a configuration of stacked blocks.
Given a game grid that is w units wide and h units tall, a castle is generated according to the following rules:
Blocks can be placed on top of other blocks as long as nothing sticks out past the edges or hangs out over open space.
All blocks are aligned/snapped to the grid.
Any two neighboring blocks on the same row have at least one unit of space between them.
The bottom row is occupied by a block of length w.

Alice is playing a game with n cards numbered 1 to n.
A game consists of iterations of the following steps.
(1) Alice picks one of the cards at random.
(2) Alice cannot see the number on it. Instead, Bob, one of her friends, sees the number and tells Alice how many previously-seen numbers are bigger than the number which he is seeing.
(3) Alice can end or continue the game. If she decides to end, the number becomes her score. If she decides to continue, the card is removed from the game and she returns to (1). If there is no card left, she is forced to end the game.
Let F(n) be the Alice's expected score if she takes the optimized strategy to minimize her score.
For example, F(3) = 5/3. At the first iteration, she should continue the game. At the second iteration, she should end the game if Bob says that one previously-seen number is bigger than the number which he is seeing, otherwise she should continue the game.

However, after a lot of games of Nim they got bored and changed the rules somewhat.

So if a pile contains one stone they can't take the last stone from it as 1 isn't a proper divisor of 1.
The first player that can't make a valid move loses the game.
Of course both Anton and Bertrand play optimally.

514,Geoboard Shapes,Problem 514,"
A geoboard (of order N) is a square board with equally-spaced pins protruding from the surface, representing an integer point lattice for coordinates 0 ≤ x,y ≤ N.
John begins with a pinless geoboard. Each position on the board is a hole that can be filled with a pin. John decides to generate a random integer between 1 and N+1 (inclusive) for each hole in the geoboard. If the random integer is equal to 1 for a given hole, then a pin is placed in that hole.
After John is finished generating numbers for all (N+1)2 holes and placing any/all corresponding pins, he wraps a tight rubberband around the entire group of pins protruding from the board. Let S represent the shape that is formed. S can also be defined as the smallest convex shape that contains all the pins.

The above image depicts a sample layout for N = 4. The green markers indicate positions where pins have been placed, and the blue lines collectively represent the rubberband. For this particular arrangement, S has an area of 6. If there are fewer than three pins on the board (or if all pins are collinear), S can be assumed to have zero area.
Let E(N) be the expected area of S given a geoboard of order N. For example, E(1) = 0.18750, E(2) = 0.94335, and E(10) = 55.03013 when rounded to five decimal places each.

522,Hilbert's Blackout,Problem 522,"
Despite the popularity of Hilbert's infinite hotel, Hilbert decided to try managing extremely large finite hotels, instead.
To cut costs, Hilbert wished to power the new hotel with his own special generator. Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the top floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.
Unfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert's freedom to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on certain floors.
For example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:

If the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that while a given floor can receive power from many other floors at once, it can only send power to one other floor.
To resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal number of floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it sends power to. In the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts can be avoided by rewiring the second floor to send power to the first floor instead of the third floor.
Let F(n) be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed over all possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of n floors. For example, F(3) = 6, F(8) = 16276736, and F(100) mod 135707531 = 84326147.

527,Randomized Binary Search,Problem 527,"
A secret integer t is selected at random within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ n. 
The goal is to guess the value of t by making repeated guesses, via integer g. After a guess is made, there are three possible outcomes, in which it will be revealed that either g < t, g = t, or g > t. Then the process can repeat as necessary.
Normally, the number of guesses required on average can be minimized with a binary search: Given a lower bound L and upper bound H (initialized to L = 1 and H = n), let g = ⌊(L+H)/2⌋ where ⌊⋅⌋ is the integer floor function. If g = t, the process ends. Otherwise, if g < t, set L = g+1, but if g > t instead, set H = g−1. After setting the new bounds, the search process repeats, and ultimately ends once t is found. Even if t can be deduced without searching, assume that a search will be required anyway to confirm the value.
Your friend Bob believes that the standard binary search is not that much better than his randomized variant: Instead of setting g = ⌊(L+H)/2⌋, simply let g be a random integer between L and H, inclusive. The rest of the algorithm is the same as the standard binary search. This new search routine will be referred to as a random binary search.
Given that 1 ≤ t ≤ n for random t, let B(n) be the expected number of guesses needed to find t using the standard binary search, and let R(n) be the expected number of guesses needed to find t using the random binary search. For example, B(6) = 2.33333333 and R(6) = 2.71666667 when rounded to 8 decimal places.

Bob is a manufacturer of nanobots and wants to impress his customers by giving them a ball coloured by his new nanobots as a present.
His nanobots can be programmed to select and locate exactly one other bot precisely and, after activation, move towards this bot along the shortest possible path and draw a coloured line onto the surface while moving. Placed on a plane, the bots will start to move towards their selected bots in a straight line. In contrast, being placed on a ball, they will start to move along a geodesic as the shortest possible path. However, in both cases, whenever their target moves they will adjust their direction instantaneously to the new shortest possible path. All bots will move at the same speed after their simultaneous activation until each bot reaches its goal.
Now Bob places n bots on the ball (with radius 1) equidistantly on a small circle with radius 0.999 and programs each of them to move toward the next nanobot sitting counterclockwise on that small circle. After activation, the bots move in a sort of spiral until they finally meet at one point on the ball.
Using three bots, Bob finds that every bot will draw a line of length 2.84, resulting in a total length of 8.52 for all three bots, each time rounded to two decimal places. The coloured ball looks like this:

In order to show off a little with his presents, Bob decides to use just enough bots to make sure that the line each bot draws is longer than 1000. What is the total length of all lines drawn with this number of bots, rounded to two decimal places?

534,Weak Queens,Problem 534,"
The classical eight queens puzzle is the well known problem of placing eight chess queens on a 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Allowing configurations to reappear in rotated or mirrored form, a total of 92 distinct configurations can be found for eight queens. The general case asks for the number of distinct ways of placing n queens on a n×n board, e.g. you can find 2 distinct configurations for n=4.
Let's define a weak queen on a n×n board to be a piece which can move any number of squares if moved horizontally, but a maximum of n−1−w squares if moved vertically or diagonally, 0≤w<n being the ""weakness factor"". For example, a weak queen on a n×n board with a weakness factor of w=1 located in the bottom row will not be able to threaten any square in the top row as the weak queen would need to move n−1 squares vertically or diagonally to get there, but may only move n−2 squares in these directions. In contrast, the weak queen is not handicapped horizontally, thus threatening every square in its own row, independently from its current position in that row.
Let Q(n,w) be the number of ways n weak queens with weakness factor w can be placed on a n×n board so that no two queens threaten each other. It can be shown, for example, that Q(4,0)=2, Q(4,2)=16 and Q(4,3)=256.

Let f(S) be the perimeter of the maximum-area quadrilateral whose side lengths are 4 elements (si, sj, sk, sl) of S (all i, j, k, l distinct). If there are many quadrilaterals with the same maximum area, then choose the one with the largest perimeter.
For example, if S = (8, 9, 14, 9, 27), then we can take the elements (9, 14, 9, 27) and form an isosceles trapezium with parallel side lengths 14 and 27 and both leg lengths 9. The area of this quadrilateral is 127.611470879... It can be shown that this is the largest area for any quadrilateral that can be formed using side lengths from S. Therefore, f(S) = 9 + 14 + 9 + 27 = 59.
Let un = 2B(3n) + 3B(2n) + B(n+1), where B(k) is the number of 1 bits of k in base 2.

547,Distance of random points within hollow square laminae,Problem 547,"
Assuming that two points are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) within a rectangle, it is possible to determine the expected value of the distance between these two points.
For example, the expected distance between two random points in a unit square is about 0.521405, while the expected distance between two random points in a rectangle with side lengths 2 and 3 is about 1.317067.
Now we define a hollow square lamina of size n to be an integer sized square with side length n ≥ 3 consisting of n2 unit squares from which a rectangle consisting of x × y unit squares (1 ≤ x,y ≤ n - 2) within the original square has been removed.
For n = 3 there exists only one hollow square lamina:

For n = 4 you can find 9 distinct hollow square laminae, allowing shapes to reappear in rotated or mirrored form:

Let S(n) be the sum of the expected distance between two points chosen randomly within each of the possible hollow square laminae of size n. The two points have to lie within the area left after removing the inner rectangle, i.e. the gray-colored areas in the illustrations above.
For example, S(3) = 1.6514 and S(4) = 19.6564, rounded to four digits after the decimal point.

z1z2=a1+b1ia2+b2i=(a1+b1i)(a2−b2i)(a2+b2i)(a2−b2i)=a1a2+b1b2a22+b22+a2b1−a1b2a22+b22i=a3+b3i
So, z1 is divisible by z2 if a1a2+b1b2a22+b22 and a2b1−a1b2a22+b22 are integers.
For example, 2 is divisible by 1 + i because 2/(1 + i) = 1 - i is a Gaussian integer.
A Gaussian prime is a Gaussian integer that is divisible only by a unit, itself or itself times a unit.
For example, 1 + 2i is a Gaussian prime, because it is only divisible by 1, i, -1, -i, 1 + 2i, i(1 + 2i) = i - 2, -(1 + 2i) = -1 - 2i and -i(1 + 2i) = 2 - i.
2 is not a Gaussian prime as it is divisible by 1 + i.
A Gaussian integer can be uniquely factored as the product of a unit and proper Gaussian primes.
For example 2 = -i(1 + i)2 and 1 + 3i = (1 + i)(2 + i).
A Gaussian integer is said to be squarefree if its prime factorization does not contain repeated proper Gaussian primes.
So 2 is not squarefree over the Gaussian integers, but 1 + 3i is.
Units and Gaussian primes are squarefree by definition.
Let f(n) be the count of proper squarefree Gaussian integers with a2 + b2 ≤ n.
For example f(10) = 7 because 1, 1 + i, 1 + 2i, 1 + 3i = (1 + i)(2 + i), 2 + i, 3 and 3 + i = -i(1 + i)(1 + 2i) are squarefree, while 2 = -i(1 + i)2 and 2 + 2i = -i(1 + i)3 are not.
You are given f(102) = 54, f(104) = 5218 and f(108) = 52126906.

557,Cutting triangles,Problem 557,"

A triangle is cut into four pieces by two straight lines, each starting at one vertex and ending on the opposite edge. This results in forming three smaller triangular pieces, and one quadrilateral.  If the original triangle has an integral area, it is often possible to choose cuts such that all of the four pieces also have integral area.  For example, the diagram below shows a triangle of area 55 that has been cut in this way.



Representing the areas as a, b, c and d, in the example above, the individual areas are a = 22, b = 8, c = 11 and d = 14.  It is also possible to cut a triangle of area 55 such that a = 20, b = 2, c = 24, d = 9.

Define a triangle cutting quadruple (a, b, c, d) as a valid integral division of a triangle, where a is the area of the triangle between the two cut vertices, d is the area of the quadrilateral and b and c are the areas of the two other triangles, with the restriction that b ≤ c.  The two solutions described above are (22,8,11,14) and (20,2,24,9).  These are the only two possible quadruples that have a total area of 55.


Define S(n) as the sum of the area of the uncut triangles represented by all valid quadruples with a+b+c+d ≤ n. For example, S(20) = 259.

A company specialises in producing large rectangular metal sheets, starting from unit square metal plates.  The welding is performed by a range of robots of increasing size.  Unfortunately, the programming options of these robots are rather limited.  Each one can only process up to 25 identical rectangles of metal, which they can weld along either edge to produce a larger rectangle.  The only programmable variables are the number of rectangles to be processed (up to and including 25), and whether to weld the long or short edge.
For example, the first robot could be programmed to weld together 11 raw unit square plates to make a 11×1 strip.  The next could take 10 of these 11×1 strips, and weld them either to make a longer 110×1 strip, or a 11×10 rectangle.  Many, but not all, possible dimensions of  metal sheets can be constructed in this way.
One regular customer has a particularly unusual order: The finished product should have an exact area, and the long side must not be more than 10% larger than the short side. If these requirements can be met in more than one way, in terms of the exact dimensions of the two sides, then the customer will demand that all variants be produced. For example, if the order calls for a metal sheet of area 889200, then there are three final dimensions that can be produced: 900×988, 912×975 and 936×950.

566,Cake Icing Puzzle,Problem 566,"
Adam plays the following game with his birthday cake.
He cuts a piece forming a circular sector of 60 degrees and flips the piece upside down, with the icing on the bottom.
He then rotates the cake by 60 degrees counterclockwise, cuts an adjacent 60 degree piece and flips it upside down.
He keeps repeating this, until after a total of twelve steps, all the icing is back on top.
Amazingly, this works for any piece size, even if the cutting angle is an irrational number: all the icing will be back on top after a finite number of steps.
Now, Adam tries something different: he alternates cutting pieces of size x=3609 degrees, y=36010 degrees and z=36011 degrees. The first piece he cuts has size x and he flips it. The second has size y and he flips it. The third has size z and he flips it. He repeats this with pieces of size x, y and z in that order until all the icing is back on top, and discovers he needs 60 flips altogether.

Let F(a, b, c) be the minimum number of piece flips needed to get all the icing back on top for pieces of size x=360a degrees, y=360b degrees and z=360c degrees.
Let G(n)=∑9≤a<b<c≤nF(a,b,c), for integers a, b and c.

It was quite an ordinary day when a mysterious alien vessel appeared as if from nowhere. After waiting several hours and receiving no response it is decided to send a team to investigate, of which you are included. Upon entering the vessel you are met by a friendly holographic figure, Katharina, who explains the purpose of the vessel, Eulertopia.
She claims that Eulertopia is almost older than time itself. Its mission was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So, for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the rooms would be numbered in the following way.


Many millenia ago Leonhard reported to Katharina to have found the answer and he is willing to share it with any life form who proves to be worthy of such knowledge.
Katharina further explains that the designers of Leonhard were given instructions to program him with equal probability of remaining in the same room or travelling to an adjacent room. However, it was not clear to them if this meant (i) an equal probability being split equally between remaining in the room and the number of available routes, or, (ii) an equal probability (50%) of remaining in the same room and then the other 50% was to be split equally between the number of available routes.

(i) Probability of remaining related to number of exits
(ii) Fixed 50% probability of remaining

The records indicate that they decided to flip a coin. Heads would mean that the probability of remaining was dynamically related to the number of exits whereas tails would mean that they program Leonhard with a fixed 50% probability of remaining in a particular room. Unfortunately there is no record of the outcome of the coin, so without further information we would need to assume that there is equal probability of either of the choices being implemented.
Katharina suggests it should not be too challenging to determine that the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in a 5 by 5 grid after unfathomable periods of time would be approximately 0.177976190476 [12 d.p.].
In order to prove yourself worthy of visiting the great oracle you must calculate the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in the 1000 by 1000 lair in which he has been wandering.

584,Birthday Problem Revisited,Problem 584,"
A long long time ago in a galaxy far far away, the Wimwians, inhabitants of planet WimWi, discovered an unmanned drone that had landed on their planet. On examining the drone, they uncovered a device that sought the answer for the so called ""Birthday Problem"". The description of the problem was as follows:
If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find 3 people with Birthdays within 1 day from each other.
The description further instructed them to enter the answer into the device and send the drone into space again. Startled by this turn of events, the Wimwians consulted their best mathematicians. Each year on Wimwi has 10 days and the mathematicians assumed equally likely birthdays and ignored leap years (leap years in Wimwi have 11 days), and found 5.78688636 to be the required answer. As such, the Wimwians entered this answer and sent the drone back into space.
After traveling light years away, the drone then landed on planet Joka. The same events ensued except this time, the numbers in the device had changed due to some unknown technical issues. The description read:
If people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find 3 people with Birthdays within 7 days from each other.
With a 100-day year on the planet, the Jokars (inhabitants of Joka) found the answer to be 8.48967364 (rounded to 8 decimal places because the device allowed only 8 places after the decimal point) assuming equally likely birthdays. They too entered the answer into the device and launched the drone into space again.

585,Nested square roots,Problem 585,"
Consider the term x+y+z that is representing a nested square root. x, y and z are positive integers and y and z are not allowed to be perfect squares, so the number below the outer square root is irrational. Still it can be shown that for some combinations of x, y and z the given term can be simplified into a sum and/or difference of simple square roots of integers, actually denesting the square roots in the initial expression. 
Here are some examples of this denesting:
3+2+2=2+1=2+1
8+15+15=5+3
20+96+12=9+6+3−2=3+6+3−2
28+160+108=15+6+5−2
As you can see the integers used in the denested expression may also be perfect squares resulting in further simplification.
Let F(n) be the number of different terms x+y+z, that can be denested into the sum and/or difference of a finite number of square roots, given the additional condition that 0<x≤n. That is,
x+y+z=∑i=1ksiai
with k, x, y, z and all ai being positive integers, all si=±1 and x≤n. Furthermore y and z  are not allowed to be perfect squares.
Nested roots with the same value are not considered different, for example 7+3+27, 7+12+12 and 7+27+3, that can all three be denested into 2+3, would only be counted once.
You are given that F(10)=17, F(15)=46, F(20)=86, F(30)=213 and F(100)=2918 and F(5000)=11134074.

589,Poohsticks Marathon,Problem 589,"

Christopher Robin and Pooh Bear love the game of Poohsticks so much that they invented a new version which allows them to play for longer before one of them wins and they have to go home for tea. The game starts as normal with both dropping a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of a bridge. But rather than the game ending when one of the sticks emerges on the downstream side, instead they fish their sticks out of the water, and drop them back in again on the upstream side. The game only ends when one of the sticks emerges from under the bridge ahead of the other one having also 'lapped' the other stick - that is, having made one additional journey under the bridge compared to the other stick.


On a particular day when playing this game, the time taken for a stick to travel under the bridge varies between a minimum of 30 seconds, and a maximum of 60 seconds. The time taken to fish a stick out of the water and drop it back in again on the other side is 5 seconds. The current under the bridge has the unusual property that the sticks' journey time is always an integral number of seconds, and it is equally likely to emerge at any of the possible times between 30 and 60 seconds (inclusive). It turns out that under these circumstances, the expected time for playing a single game is 1036.15 seconds (rounded to 2 decimal places). This time is measured from the point of dropping the sticks for the first time, to the point where the winning stick emerges from under the bridge having lapped the other.


The stream flows at different rates each day, but maintains the property that the journey time in seconds is equally distributed amongst the integers from a minimum, n, to a maximum, m, inclusive. Let the expected time of play in seconds be E(m,n). Hence E(60,30)=1036.15...


Let S(k)=∑m=2k∑n=1m−1E(m,n).

A deck of cards numbered from 1 to n is shuffled randomly such that each permutation is equally likely.


The cards are to be sorted into ascending order using the following technique:
 Look at the initial sequence of cards.  If it is already sorted, then there is no need for further action.  Otherwise, if any subsequences of cards happen to be in the correct place relative to one another (ascending with no gaps), then those subsequences are fixed by attaching the cards together.  For example, with 7 cards initially in the order 4123756, the cards labelled 1, 2 and 3 would be attached together, as would 5 and 6.
 The cards are 'shuffled' by being thrown into the air, but note that any correctly sequenced cards remain attached, so their orders are maintained.  The cards (or bundles of attached cards) are then picked up randomly.  You should assume that this randomisation is unbiased, despite the fact that some cards are single, and others are grouped together. 
 Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the cards are sorted. 

   Let S(n) be the expected number of shuffles needed to sort the cards. Since the order is checked before the first shuffle, S(1) = 0. You are given that S(2) = 1, and S(5) = 4213/871.

597,Torpids,Problem 597,"
The Torpids are rowing races held annually in Oxford, following some curious rules:


A division consists of n boats (typically 13), placed in order based on past performance.

All boats within a division start at 40 metre intervals along the river, in order with the highest-placed boat starting furthest upstream.

The boats all start rowing simultaneously, upstream, trying to catch the boat in front while avoiding being caught by boats behind.

Each boat continues rowing until either it reaches the finish line or it catches up with (""bumps"") a boat in front.

The finish line is a distance L metres (the course length, in reality about 1800 metres) upstream from the starting position of the lowest-placed boat. (Because of the staggered starting positions, higher-placed boats row a slightly shorter course than lower-placed boats.)

When a ""bump"" occurs, the ""bumping"" boat takes no further part in the race. The ""bumped"" boat must continue, however, and may even be ""bumped"" again by boats that started two or more places behind it.

After the race, boats are assigned new places within the division, based on the bumps that occurred. Specifically, for any boat A that started in a lower place than B, then A will be placed higher than B in the new order if and only if one of the following occurred:
   A bumped B directly 
 A bumped another boat that went on to bump B 
 A bumped another boat, that bumped yet another boat, that bumped B 
 etc NOTE: For the purposes of this problem you may disregard the boats' lengths, and assume that a bump occurs precisely when the two boats draw level. (In reality, a bump is awarded as soon as physical contact is made, which usually occurs when there is much less than a full boat length's overlap.)


Suppose that, in a particular race, each boat Bj rows at a steady speed vj=−logXj metres per second, where the Xj are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) between 0 and 1, independently from one another. These speeds are relative to the riverbank: you may disregard the flow of the river.


Let p(n,L) be the probability that the new order is an even permutation of the starting order, when there are n boats in the division and L is the course length.


For example, with n=3 and L=160, labelling the boats as A,B,C in starting order with C highest, the different possible outcomes of the race are as follows:

 Bumps occurring 
 New order 
 Permutation 
 Probability 
 none

 C, A, B 
 even

     A bumps B, then B bumps C

Therefore, p(3,160)=4/15+4/27=56/135.

","The Torpids are rowing races held annually in Oxford, following some curious rules:

<ul><li>
A division consists of $n$ boats (typically 13), placed in order based on past performance.
</li><li>
All boats within a division start at 40 metre intervals along the river, in order with the highest-placed boat starting furthest upstream.
</li><li>
The boats all start rowing simultaneously, upstream, trying to catch the boat in front while avoiding being caught by boats behind.
</li><li>
Each boat continues rowing until <em>either</em> it reaches the finish line <em>or</em> it catches up with (""bumps"") a boat in front.
</li><li>
The finish line is a distance $L$ metres (the course length, in reality about 1800 metres) upstream from the starting position of the lowest-placed boat. (Because of the staggered starting positions, higher-placed boats row a slightly shorter course than lower-placed boats.)
</li><li>
When a ""bump"" occurs, the ""bumping"" boat takes no further part in the race. The ""bumped"" boat must continue, however, and may even be ""bumped"" again by boats that started two or more places behind it.
</li><li>
After the race, boats are assigned new places within the division, based on the bumps that occurred. Specifically, for any boat $A$ that started in a lower place than $B$, then $A$ will be placed higher than $B$ in the new order if and only if one of the following occurred:
  <ol><li> $A$ bumped $B$ directly </li>
  <li> $A$ bumped another boat that went on to bump $B$ </li>
  <li> $A$ bumped another boat, that bumped yet another boat, that bumped $B$ </li>
  <li> etc </li></ol></li></ul><b>NOTE</b>: For the purposes of this problem you may disregard the boats' lengths, and assume that a bump occurs precisely when the two boats draw level. (In reality, a bump is awarded as soon as physical contact is made, which usually occurs when there is much less than a full boat length's overlap.)

<p>
Suppose that, in a particular race, each boat $B_j$ rows at a steady speed $v_j = -$log$X_j$ metres per second, where the $X_j$ are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) between 0 and 1, independently from one another. These speeds are relative to the riverbank: you may disregard the flow of the river.
</p>
<p>
Let $p(n,L)$ be the probability that the new order is an <b>even permutation</b> of the starting order, when there are $n$ boats in the division and $L$ is the course length.
</p>
<p>
For example, with $n=3$ and $L=160$, labelling the boats as $A$,$B$,$C$ in starting order with $C$ highest, the different possible outcomes of the race are as follows:
</p>
<table cellspacing=""15"" align=""center""><tr><th> Bumps occurring </th>

599,Distinct Colourings of a Rubik's Cube,Problem 599,"

The well-known Rubik's Cube puzzle has many fascinating mathematical properties. The 2×2×2 variant has 8 cubelets with a total of 24 visible faces, each with a coloured sticker. Successively turning faces will rearrange the cubelets, although not all arrangements of cubelets are reachable without dismantling the puzzle.


Suppose that we wish to apply new stickers to a 2×2×2 Rubik's cube in a non-standard colouring. Specifically, we have n different colours available (with an unlimited supply of stickers of each colour), and we place one sticker on each of the 24 faces in any arrangement that we please. We are not required to use all the colours, and if desired the same colour may appear in more than one face of a single cubelet.


We say that two such colourings c1,c2 are essentially distinct if a cube coloured according to c1 cannot be made to match a cube coloured according to c2 by performing mechanically possible Rubik's Cube moves.


For example, with two colours available, there are 183 essentially distinct colourings.


How many essentially distinct colourings are there with 10 different colours available?

602,Product of Head Counts,Problem 602,"

Alice enlists the help of some friends to generate a random number, using a single unfair coin. She and her friends sit around a table and, starting with Alice, they take it in turns to toss the coin. Everyone keeps a count of how many heads they obtain individually. The process ends as soon as Alice obtains a Head. At this point, Alice multiplies all her friends' Head counts together to obtain her random number.


As an illustration, suppose Alice is assisted by Bob, Charlie, and Dawn, who are seated round the table in that order, and that they obtain the sequence of Head/Tail outcomes THHH—TTTT—THHT—H beginning and ending with Alice. Then Bob and Charlie each obtain 2 heads, and Dawn obtains 1 head. Alice's random number is therefore 2×2×1=4.


Define e(n,p) to be the expected value of Alice's random number, where n is the number of friends helping (excluding Alice herself), and p is the probability of the coin coming up Tails.


It turns out that, for any fixed n, e(n,p) is always a polynomial in p. For example, e(3,p)=p3+4p2+p.


Define c(n,k) to be the coefficient of pk in the polynomial e(n,p). So c(3,1)=1, c(3,2)=4, and c(3,3)=1.

However, their path is crossed by a long marsh which runs exactly South-West to North-East, and walking through the marsh will slow them down. The marsh is 50 leagues wide at all points, and the mid-point of AB is located in the middle of the marsh. A map of the region is shown in the diagram below:




The marsh consists of 5 distinct regions, each 10 leagues across, as shown by the shading in the map. The strip closest to point A is relatively light marsh, and can be crossed at a speed of 9 leagues per day. However, each strip becomes progressively harder to navigate, the speeds going down to 8, 7, 6 and finally 5 leagues per day for the final region of marsh, before it ends and the terrain becomes easier again, with the speed going back to 10 leagues per day.


If Frodo and Sam were to head directly East for point B, they would travel exactly 100 leagues, and the journey would take approximately 13.4738 days. However, this time can be shortened if they deviate from the direct path.

610,Roman Numerals II,Problem 610,"
A random generator produces a sequence of symbols drawn from the set {I, V, X, L, C, D, M, #}. Each item in the sequence is determined by selecting one of these symbols at random, independently of the other items in the sequence. At each step, the seven letters are equally likely to be selected, with probability 14% each, but the # symbol only has a 2% chance of selection.
We write down the sequence of letters from left to right as they are generated, and we stop at the first occurrence of the # symbol (without writing it). However, we stipulate that what we have written down must always (when non-empty) be a valid Roman numeral representation in minimal form. If appending the next letter would contravene this then we simply skip it and try again with the next symbol generated.
Please take careful note of About... Roman Numerals for the definitive rules for this problem on what constitutes a ""valid Roman numeral representation"" and ""minimal form"". For example, the (only) sequence that represents 49 is XLIX. The subtractive combination IL is invalid because of rule (ii), while XXXXIX is valid but not minimal. The rules do not place any restriction on the number of occurrences of M, so all positive integers have a valid representation. These are the same rules as were used in Problem 89, and members are invited to solve that problem first.
Find the expected value of the number represented by what we have written down when we stop. (If nothing is written down then count that as zero.) Give your answer rounded to 8 places after the decimal point.

Four other distinct circles, which we call ""planets"", with circumferences p, p, q, q centimetres respectively (p<q), are inscribed within C but outside S, with each planet touching both C and S tangentially. The planets are permitted to overlap one another, but the boundaries of S and C must be at least 1cm apart at their closest point.
Now suppose that these circles are actually gears with perfectly meshing teeth at a pitch of 1cm. C is an internal gear with teeth on the inside. We require that c, s, p, q are all integers (as they are the numbers of teeth), and we further stipulate that any gear must have at least 5 teeth.
Note that ""perfectly meshing"" means that as the gears rotate, the ratio between their angular velocities remains constant, and the teeth of one gear perfectly align with the groves of the other gear and vice versa. Only for certain gear sizes and positions will it be possible for S and C each to mesh perfectly with all the planets. Arrangements where not all gears mesh perfectly are not valid.

Next, the cards are interleaved exactly, with the top card in the right half inserted just after the top card in the left half, the 2nd card in the right half just after the 2nd card in the left half, etc. (Note that this process preserves the location of the top and bottom card of the deck)


Let s(n) be the minimum number of consecutive riffle shuffles needed to restore a deck of size n to its original configuration, where n is a positive even number.

Amazingly, a standard deck of 52 cards will first return to its original configuration after only 8 perfect shuffles, so s(52)=8. It can be verified that a deck of 86 cards will also return to its original configuration after exactly 8 shuffles, and the sum of all values of n that satisfy s(n)=8 is 412.


Find the sum of all values of n that satisfy s(n)=60.

623,Lambda Count,Problem 623,"
The lambda-calculus is a universal model of computation at the core of functional programming languages. It is based on lambda-terms, a minimal programming language featuring only function definitions, function calls and variables. Lambda-terms are built according to the following rules:
Any variable x (single letter, from some infinite alphabet) is a lambda-term.
If M and N are lambda-terms, then (MN) is a lambda-term, called the application of M to N.
If x is a variable and M is a term, then (λx.M) is a lambda-term, called an abstraction. An abstraction defines an anonymous function, taking x as parameter and sending back M.
A lambda-term T is said to be closed if for all variables x, all occurrences of x within T are contained within some abstraction (λx.M) in T. The smallest such abstraction is said to bind the occurrence of the variable x. In other words, a lambda-term is closed if all its variables are bound to parameters of enclosing functions definitions. For example, the term (λx.x) is closed, while the term (λx.(xy)) is not because y is not bound.
Also, we can rename variables as long as no binding abstraction changes. This means that (λx.x) and (λy.y) should be considered equivalent since we merely renamed a parameter. Two terms equivalent modulo such renaming are called α-equivalent. Note that (λx.(λy.(xy))) and (λx.(λx.(xx))) are not α-equivalent, since the abstraction binding the first variable was the outer one and becomes the inner one. However, (λx.(λy.(xy))) and (λy.(λx.(yx))) are α-equivalent.
The following table regroups the lambda-terms that can be written with at most 15 symbols, symbols being parenthesis, λ, dot and variables.
(λx.x)(λx.(xx))(λx.(λy.x))(λx.(λy.y))(λx.(x(xx)))(λx.((xx)x))(λx.(λy.(xx)))(λx.(λy.(xy)))(λx.(λy.(yx)))(λx.(λy.(yy)))(λx.(x(λy.x)))(λx.(x(λy.y)))(λx.((λy.x)x))(λx.((λy.y)x))((λx.x)(λx.x))(λx.(x(x(xx))))(λx.(x((xx)x)))(λx.((xx)(xx)))(λx.((x(xx))x))(λx.(((xx)x)x))
Let be Λ(n) the number of distinct closed lambda-terms that can be written using at most n symbols, where terms that are α-equivalent to one another should be counted only once. You are given that Λ(6)=1, Λ(9)=2, Λ(15)=20 and Λ(35)=3166438.

During a player's turn, he/she must pick a pile having at least 2 stones and perform a split operation, dividing the pile into an arbitrary set of p non-empty, arbitrarily-sized piles where 2≤p≤k for some fixed constant k. For example, a pile of size 4 can be split into {1,3} or {2,2}, or {1,1,2} if k=3 and in addition {1,1,1,1} if k=4.
If no valid move is possible on a given turn, then the other player wins the game.

644,Squares on the line,Problem 644,"
Sam and Tom are trying a game of (partially) covering a given line segment of length L by taking turns in placing unit squares onto the line segment. 
As illustrated below, the squares may be positioned in two different ways, either ""straight"" by placing the midpoints of two opposite sides on the line segment, or ""diagonal"" by placing two opposite corners on the line segment. Newly placed squares may touch other squares, but are not allowed to overlap any other square laid down before.
The player who is able to place the last unit square onto the line segment wins.



With Sam starting each game by placing the first square, they quickly realise that Sam can easily win every time by placing the first square in the middle of the line segment, making the game boring. 

Therefore they decide to randomise Sam's first move, by first tossing a fair coin to determine whether the square will be placed straight or diagonal onto the line segment and then choosing the actual position on the line segment randomly with all possible positions being equally likely. Sam's gain of the game is defined to be 0 if he loses the game and L if he wins. Assuming optimal play of both players after Sam's initial move, you can see that Sam's expected gain, called e(L), is only dependent on the length of the line segment.

For example, if L=2, Sam will win with a probability of 1, so e(2)=2. 
Choosing L=4, the winning probability will be 0.33333333 for the straight case and 0.22654092 for the diagonal case, leading to e(4)=1.11974851 (rounded to 8 digits after the decimal point each). 

Being interested in the optimal value of L for Sam, let's define f(a,b) to be the maximum of e(L) for some L∈[a,b]. 
You are given f(2,10)=2.61969775, being reached for L=7.82842712, and f(10,20)=5.99374121 (rounded to 8 digits each).

","<p>Sam and Tom are trying a game of (partially) covering a given line segment of length $L$ by taking turns in placing unit squares onto the line segment. </p>

<p>As illustrated below, the squares may be positioned in two different ways, either ""straight"" by placing the midpoints of two opposite sides on the line segment, or ""diagonal"" by placing two opposite corners on the line segment. Newly placed squares may touch other squares, but are not allowed to overlap any other square laid down before.<br />
The player who is able to place the last unit square onto the line segment wins.</p>
<div class=""center"">
<img src=""https://projecteuler.net/project/images/p644_squareline.png"" alt=""p644_squareline.png"" /></div>
<p>
With Sam starting each game by placing the first square, they quickly realise that Sam can easily win every time by placing the first square in the middle of the line segment, making the game boring. </p>
<p>
Therefore they decide to randomise Sam's first move, by first tossing a fair coin to determine whether the square will be placed straight or diagonal onto the line segment and then choosing the actual position on the line segment randomly with all possible positions being equally likely. Sam's gain of the game is defined to be 0 if he loses the game and $L$ if he wins. Assuming optimal play of both players after Sam's initial move, you can see that Sam's expected gain, called $e(L)$, is only dependent on the length of the line segment.</p>

The game may start with any arrangement of c coins in squares on the board. It is possible at any time for more than one coin to occupy the same square on the board at the same time. The coins are distinguishable, so swapping two coins gives a different arrangement if (and only if) they are on different squares.
On a given turn, the player must choose a coin and move it either left or up 2, 3, 5, or 7 spaces in a single direction. The only restriction is that the coin cannot move off the edge of the board.

653,Frictionless Tube,Problem 653,"
Consider a horizontal frictionless tube with length L millimetres, and a diameter of 20 millimetres. The east end of the tube is open, while the west end is sealed. The tube contains N marbles of diameter 20 millimetres at designated starting locations, each one initially moving either westward or eastward with common speed v.
Since there are marbles moving in opposite directions, there are bound to be some collisions. We assume that the collisions are perfectly elastic, so both marbles involved instantly change direction and continue with speed v away from the collision site. Similarly, if the west-most marble collides with the sealed end of the tube, it instantly changes direction and continues eastward at speed v. On the other hand, once a marble reaches the unsealed east end, it exits the tube and has no further interaction with the remaining marbles.
To obtain the starting positions and initial directions, we use the pseudo-random sequence rj defined by:
r1=6563116
rj+1=rj2mod32745673
The west-most marble is initially positioned with a gap of (r1mod1000)+1 millimetres between it and the sealed end of the tube, measured from the west-most point of the surface of the marble. Then, for 2≤j≤N, counting from the west, the gap between the (j−1)th and jth marbles, as measured from their closest points, is given by (rjmod1000)+1 millimetres.
Furthermore, the jth marble is initially moving eastward if rj≤10000000, and westward if rj>10000000.
For example, with N=3, the sequence specifies gaps of 117, 432, and 173 millimetres. The marbles' centres are therefore 127, 579, and 772 millimetres from the sealed west end of the tube. The west-most marble initially moves eastward, while the other two initially move westward.
Under this setup, and with a five metre tube (L=5000), it turns out that the middle (second) marble travels 5519 millimetres before its centre reaches the east-most end of the tube.
Let d(L,N,j) be the distance in millimetres that the jth marble travels before its centre reaches the eastern end of the tube. So d(5000,3,2)=5519. You are also given that d(10000,11,6)=11780 and d(100000,101,51)=114101.

Furthermore, the $j$th marble is initially moving eastward if $r_j \le 10\,000\,000$, and westward if $r_j &gt; 10\,000\,000$.</p>

<p>For example, with $N=3$, the sequence specifies gaps of 117, 432, and 173 millimetres. The marbles' <i>centres</i> are therefore 127, 579, and 772 millimetres from the sealed west end of the tube. The west-most marble initially moves eastward, while the other two initially move westward.</p>

<p>Under this setup, and with a five metre tube ($L=5000$), it turns out that the middle (second) marble travels 5519 millimetres before its centre reaches the east-most end of the tube.</p>

<p>Let $d(L, N, j)$ be the distance in millimetres that the $j$th marble travels before its centre reaches the eastern end of the tube. So $d(5000, 3, 2) = 5519$. You are also given that $d(10\,000, 11, 6) = 11\,780$ and $d(100\,000, 101, 51) = 114\,101$.</p>

Two friends A and B are great fans of Chess. They both enjoy playing the game, but after each game the player who lost the game would like to continue (to get back at the other player) and the player who won would prefer to stop (to finish on a high).
So they come up with a plan. After every game, they would toss a (biased) coin with probability p of Heads (and hence probability 1−p of Tails). If they get Tails, they will continue with the next game. Otherwise they end the match. Also, after every game the players make a note of who is leading in the match.
Let pA denote the probability of A winning a game and pB the probability of B winning a game. Accordingly 1−pA−pB is the probability that a game ends in a draw. Let EA(pA,pB,p) denote the expected number of times A was leading in the match.

666,Polymorphic Bacteria,Problem 666,"
Members of a species of bacteria occur in two different types: α and β. Individual bacteria are capable of multiplying and mutating between the types according to the following rules:
Every minute, each individual will simultaneously undergo some kind of transformation.
Each individual A of type α will, independently, do one of the following (at random with equal probability):
clone itself, resulting in a new bacterium of type α (alongside A who remains)
split into 3 new bacteria of type β (replacing A)

Each individual B of type β will, independently, do one of the following (at random with equal probability):
spawn a new bacterium of type α (alongside B who remains)
die

If a population starts with a single bacterium of type α, then it can be shown that there is a 0.07243802 probability that the population will eventually die out, and a 0.92756198 probability that the population will last forever. These probabilities are given rounded to 8 decimal places.


Now consider another species of bacteria, Sk,m (where k and m are positive integers), which occurs in k different types αi for 0≤i<k. The rules governing this species' lifecycle involve the sequence rn defined by:

r0=306
rn+1=rn2mod10007

Every minute, for each i, each bacterium A of type αi will independently choose an integer j uniformly at random in the range 0≤j<m. What it then does depends on q=rim+jmod5:
If q=0, A dies.
If q=1, A clones itself, resulting in a new bacterium of type αi (alongside A who remains).
If q=2, A mutates, changing into type α(2i)modk.
If q=3, A splits into 3 new bacteria of type α(i2+1)modk (replacing A).
If q=4, A spawns a new bacterium of type α(i+1)modk (alongside A who remains).

In fact, our original species was none other than S2,2, with α=α0 and β=α1.


Let Pk,m be the probability that a population of species Sk,m, starting with a single bacterium of type α0, will eventually die out. So P2,2=0.07243802. You are also given that P4,3=0.18554021 and P10,5=0.53466253, all rounded to 8 decimal places.

669,The King's Banquet,Problem 669,"
The Knights of the Order of Fibonacci are preparing a grand feast for their king. There are n knights, and each knight is assigned a distinct number from 1 to n.
When the knights sit down at the roundtable for their feast, they follow a peculiar seating rule: two knights can only sit next to each other if their respective numbers sum to a Fibonacci number.
When the n knights all try to sit down around a circular table with n chairs, they are unable to find a suitable seating arrangement for any n>2 despite their best efforts. Just when they are about to give up, they remember that the king will sit on his throne at the table as well.
Suppose there are n=7 knights and 7 chairs at the roundtable, in addition to the king’s throne. After some trial and error, they come up with the following seating arrangement (K represents the king):


Notice that the sums 4+1, 1+7, 7+6, 6+2, 2+3, and 3+5 are all Fibonacci numbers, as required. It should also be mentioned that the king always prefers an arrangement where the knight to the his left has a smaller number than the knight to his right. With this additional rule, the above arrangement is unique for n=7, and the knight sitting in the 3rd chair from the king’s left is knight number 7.
Later, several new knights are appointed to the Order, giving 34 knights and chairs in addition to the king's throne. The knights eventually determine that there is a unique seating arrangement for n=34 satisfying the above rules, and this time knight number 30 is sitting in the 3rd chair from the king's left.
Now suppose there are n=99194853094755497 knights and the same number of chairs at the roundtable (not including the king’s throne). After great trials and tribulations, they are finally able to find the unique seating arrangement for this value of n that satisfies the above rules.

673,Beds and Desks,Problem 673,"
At Euler University, each of the n students (numbered from 1 to n) occupies a bed in the dormitory and uses a desk in the classroom.
Some of the beds are in private rooms which a student occupies alone, while the others are in double rooms occupied by two students as roommates. Similarly, each desk is either a single desk for the sole use of one student, or a twin desk at which two students sit together as desk partners.
We represent the bed and desk sharing arrangements each by a list of pairs of student numbers. For example, with n=4, if (2,3) represents the bed pairing and (1,3)(2,4) the desk pairing, then students 2 and 3 are roommates while 1 and 4 have single rooms, and students 1 and 3 are desk partners, as are students 2 and 4.
The new chancellor of the university decides to change the organisation of beds and desks: a permutation σ of the numbers 1,2,…,n will be chosen, and each student k will be given both the bed and the desk formerly occupied by student number σ(k).
The students agree to this change, under the conditions that:
Any two students currently sharing a room will still be roommates.
Any two students currently sharing a desk will still be desk partners.
In the example above, there are only two ways to satisfy these conditions: either take no action (σ is the identity permutation), or reverse the order of the students.
With n=6, for the bed pairing (1,2)(3,4)(5,6) and the desk pairing (3,6)(4,5), there are 8 permutations which satisfy the conditions. One example is the mapping (1,2,3,4,5,6)↦(1,2,5,6,3,4).
With n=36, if we have bed pairing:
(2,13)(4,30)(5,27)(6,16)(10,18)(12,35)(14,19)(15,20)(17,26)(21,32)(22,33)(24,34)(25,28)

(1,35)(2,22)(3,36)(4,28)(5,25)(7,18)(9,23)(13,19)(14,33)(15,34)(20,24)(26,29)(27,30)
then among the 36! possible permutations (including the identity permutation), 663552 of them satisfy the conditions stipulated by the students.
The downloadable text files beds.txt and desks.txt contain pairings for n=500. Each pairing is written on its own line, with the student numbers of the two roommates (or desk partners) separated with a comma. For example, the desk pairing in the n=4 example above would be represented in this file format as:

We define the I operator as the function
I(x,y)=(1+x+y)2+y−x
and I-expressions as arithmetic expressions built only from variable names and applications of I. A variable name may consist of one or more letters. For example, the three expressions x, I(x,y), and I(I(x,ab),x) are all I-expressions.
For two I-expressions e1 and e2 such that the equation e1=e2 has a solution in non-negative integers, we define the least simultaneous value of e1 and e2 to be the minimum value taken by e1 and e2 on such a solution. If the equation e1=e2 has no solution in non-negative integers, we define the least simultaneous value of e1 and e2 to be 0. For example, consider the following three I-expressions:
A=I(x,I(z,t))B=I(I(y,z),y)C=I(I(x,z),y)
The least simultaneous value of A and B is 23, attained for x=3,y=1,z=t=0. On the other hand, A=C has no solutions in non-negative integers, so the least simultaneous value of A and C is 0. The total sum of least simultaneous pairs made of I-expressions from {A,B,C} is 26.

690,Tom and Jerry,Problem 690,"

Tom (the cat) and Jerry (the mouse) are playing on a simple graph G.


Every vertex of G is a mousehole, and every edge of G is a tunnel connecting two mouseholes.


Originally, Jerry is hiding in one of the mouseholes.
Every morning, Tom can check one (and only one) of the mouseholes. If Jerry happens to be hiding there then Tom catches Jerry and the game is over.
Every evening, if the game continues, Jerry moves to a mousehole which is adjacent (i.e. connected by a tunnel, if there is one available) to his current hiding place. The next morning Tom checks again and the game continues like this.


Let us call a graph G a Tom graph, if our super-smart Tom, who knows the configuration of the graph but does not know the location of Jerry, can guarantee to catch Jerry in finitely many days.
For example consider all graphs on 3 nodes:




For graphs 1 and 2, Tom will catch Jerry in at most three days. For graph 3 Tom can check the middle connection on two consecutive days and hence guarantee to catch Jerry in at most two days. These three graphs are therefore Tom Graphs. However, graph 4 is not a Tom Graph because the game could potentially continue forever.


Let T(n) be the number of different Tom graphs with n vertices. Two graphs are considered the same if there is a bijection f between their vertices, such that (v,w) is an edge if and only if (f(v),f(w)) is an edge.


We have T(3)=3, T(7)=37, T(10)=328 and T(20)=1416269.

713,Turán's water heating system,Problem 713,"

Turan has the electrical water heating system outside his house in a shed. The electrical system uses two fuses in series, one in the house and one in the shed. (Nowadays old fashioned fuses are often replaced with reusable mini circuit breakers, but Turan's system still uses old fashioned fuses.)
For the heating system to work both fuses must work.


Turan has N fuses. He knows that m of them are working and the rest are blown. However, he doesn't know which ones are blown. So he tries different combinations until the heating system turns on.
We denote by T(N,m) the smallest number of tries required to ensure the heating system turns on.
T(3,2)=3 and T(8,4)=7.


Let L(N) be the sum of all T(N,m) for 2≤m≤N.
L(103)=3281346

716,Grid Graphs,Problem 716,"

Consider a directed graph made from an orthogonal lattice of H×W nodes. 
The edges are the horizontal and vertical connections between adjacent nodes.
W vertical directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that direction. Similarly, H horizontal directed lines are drawn and all the edges on these lines inherit that direction.


Two nodes, A and B in a directed graph, are strongly connected if there is both a path, along the directed edges, from A to B as well as from B to A. Note that every node is strongly connected to itself.


A strongly connected component in a directed graph is a non-empty set M of nodes satisfying the following two properties:

All nodes in M are strongly connected to each other.
M is maximal, in the sense that no node in M is strongly connected to any node outside of M.

There are 2H×2W ways of drawing the directed lines. Each way gives a directed graph G. We define S(G) to be the number of strongly connected components in G.


The illustration below shows a directed graph with H=3 and W=4 that consists of four different strongly connected components (indicated by the different colours).

726,Falling bottles,Problem 726,"

Consider a stack of bottles of wine. There are n layers in the stack with the top layer containing only one bottle and the bottom layer containing n bottles. For n=4 the stack looks like the picture below.




The collapsing process happens every time a bottle is taken. A space is created in the stack and that space is filled according to the following recursive steps:
No bottle touching from above: nothing happens. For example, taking F.
One bottle touching from above: that will drop down to fill the space creating another space. For example, taking D.
Two bottles touching from above: one will drop down to fill the space creating another space. For example, taking C.

This process happens recursively; for example, taking bottle A in the diagram above. Its place can be filled with either B or C. If it is filled with C then the space that C creates can be filled with D or E. So there are 3 different collapsing processes that can happen if A is taken, although the final shape (in this case) is the same.


Define f(n) to be the number of ways that we can take all the bottles from a stack with n layers. 
Two ways are considered different if at any step we took a different bottle or the collapsing process went differently.


You are given f(1)=1, f(2)=6 and f(3)=1008.

Also define

S(n)=∑k=1nf(k)

Secret Santa is a process that allows n people to give each other presents, so that each person gives a single present and receives a single present. At the beginning each of the n people write their name on a slip of paper and put the slip into a hat. Each person takes a random slip from the hat. If the slip has their name they draw another random slip from the hat and then put the slip with their name back into the hat. At the end everyone buys a Christmas present for the person whose name is on the slip they are holding. This process will fail if the last person draws their own name.


In this variation each of the n people gives and receives two presents. At the beginning each of the n people writes their name on two slips of paper and puts the slips into a hat (there will be 2n slips of paper in the hat). As before each person takes from the hat a random slip that does not contain their own name. Then the same person repeats this process thus ending up with two slips, neither of which contains that person's own name. Then the next person draws two slips in the same way, and so on.

","<p>For positive real numbers $a,b$, an $a\times b$ <i>torus</i> is a rectangle of width $a$ and height $b$, with left and right sides identified, as well as top and bottom sides identified. In other words, when tracing a path on the rectangle, reaching an edge results in ""wrapping round"" to the corresponding point on the opposite edge.</p>

<p>A <i>tiling</i> of a torus is a way to dissect it into equilateral triangles of edge length 1. For example, the following three diagrams illustrate respectively a $1\times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$ torus with two triangles, a $\sqrt{3}\times 1$ torus with four triangles, and an approximately $2.8432\times 2.1322$ torus with fourteen triangles:</p>

</div>

<p>Two tilings of an $a\times b$ torus are called <i>equivalent</i> if it is possible to obtain one from the other by continuously moving all triangles so that no gaps appear and no triangles overlap at any stage during the movement. For example, the animation below shows an equivalence between two tilings:</p>

824,Chess Sliders,Problem 824,"
A Slider is a chess piece that can move one square left or right.
This problem uses a cylindrical chess board where the left hand edge of the board is connected to the right hand edge. This means that a Slider that is on the left hand edge of the chess board can move to the right hand edge of the same row and vice versa.
Let L(N,K) be the number of ways K non-attacking Sliders can be placed on an N×N cylindrical chess-board.
For example, L(2,2)=4 and L(6,12)=4204761.
Find L(109,1015)mod(107+19)2.

828,Numbers Challenge,Problem 828,"
It is a common recreational problem to make a target number using a selection of other numbers. In this problem you will be given six numbers and a target number.
For example, given the six numbers 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 25, and a target of 211, one possible solution is:
211=(3+6)×25−(4×7)÷2
This uses all six numbers. However, it is not necessary to do so. Another solution that does not use the 7 is:
211=(25−2)×(6+3)+4
Define the score of a solution to be the sum of the numbers used. In the above example problem, the two given solutions have scores 47 and 40 respectively. It turns out that this problem has no solutions with score less than 40.
When combining numbers, the following rules must be observed:

Each available number may be used at most once.
Only the four basic arithmetic operations are permitted: +, −, ×, ÷.
All intermediate values must be positive integers, so for example (3÷2) is never permitted as a subexpression (even if the final answer is an integer).

The attached file number-challenges.txt contains 200 problems, one per line in the format:
211:2,3,4,6,7,25
where the number before the colon is the target and the remaining comma-separated numbers are those available to be used.
Numbering the problems 1, 2, ..., 200, we let sn be the minimum score of the solution to the nth problem. For example, s1=40, as the first problem in the file is the example given above. Note that not all problems have a solution; in such cases we take sn=0.

Given any integer n>1 a binary factor tree T(n) is defined to be:

A tree with the single node n when n is prime.
A binary tree that has root node n, left subtree T(a) and right subtree T(b), when n is not prime. Here a and b are positive integers such that n=ab, a≤b and b−a is the smallest.

For example T(20):
